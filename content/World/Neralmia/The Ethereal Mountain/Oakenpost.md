A humble settlement set in the Ethereal Mountain, used as a resting point for weary travelers who journey through it. It is known for exporting local goods, such as herbalist reagents and valuable minerals from deep within the mountain. Due to the dense fog that often shrouds the area, the locals are often hired as guides. Several adventurers have dismissed their help, only to never be found ever again.
