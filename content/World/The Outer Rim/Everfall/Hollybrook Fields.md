A humble farm in [[Everfall]], far south of [[Dawnhearth]] and by the river.

Owned and maintained by [[Barron Stoneheart]].

Its main produce is wheat, but one could also rent a horse and carriage from here--as long as they have the ability to ride it.

An unmapped bridge can be found to the west of the farm, giving way to an alternate pathway to [[Hazelport]].
