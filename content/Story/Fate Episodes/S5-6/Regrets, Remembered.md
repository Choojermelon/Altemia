<p class="kitah">Kitah:</p>

I… I had that nightmare, again. That day in [[Lanuk Forest]], when I lost her… It ends the same way every time, no matter what. Those… ruffians ambush us, corner us, try to take us as slaves… [[Mirah]], headstrong as ever, jumps in to give me an opening to escape, and I can do nothing but watch that blade stab through her. This time, I tried to fight back instead of running away, but… I’m nowhere near strong enough. I couldn’t save her, and I couldn’t protect myself, either… 

<p class="mirah">Mirah:</p>

Sigh… Brother still blames himself for my death. No matter how much I try to tell him it isn’t his fault… But he’s always been the one to keep us safe. That day, I thought it’d finally be my turn to protect him, for once. And I still don’t regret it, otherwise both of us would have been dead, or slaves… but ever since, he’s been shouldering the guilt from it all on his own. I hope he realizes someday that he doesn’t need to…

[[Mister Twig]]’s the real MVP, though! While I was trying to console [[Kitah]], the little guy came over, and led us outside where he made us some flower crowns! I don’t have [[Kloros]]’ leshy-speak, but I could tell he felt [[Kitah]]’s pain and that this was his way of trying to cheer him up. I’m sure [[Kitah]] could tell, too, because he lightened up a little after that. I was worried he’d be down in the dumps for a while, but we passed by the tavern for a little meal and he finished the swamp soup we ordered! That means he’s at least halfway back to his usual self! I’m glad…
