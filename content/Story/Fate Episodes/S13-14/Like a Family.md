I had a rather heartfelt conversation with [[Kitah]] this morning, and all because I’d overworked myself. I’ll try not to learn the wrong lessons from that!

  

I awoke early in the morning, even more than usual, to contribute to the edification of the kitchen area. I’d rather like to see [[Eilun]]’s tea-brewing prowess for myself, after all! But it was hard work, and at the crack of dawn too… So I suppose it’s no surprise that I fell asleep on the couch before even making it back to [[Astar]].

  

An undetermined amount of time later (it couldn’t have been too long, surely), I was awoken by Kitah, who had discovered me sleeping there–and with rather poor posture, I might add! But my body appreciated the rest all the same. I sat up, and the two of us simply talked for a bit.

  

Kitah told me that things had gone well with Eilun, and of a wonderful day they’d shared together in which they’d confessed their feelings for each other. I was overcome with joy, and flung myself into a hug with Kitah next to me; not how I expected to react, but it just felt right. We squeezed for a while, before he asked me how things had been with Astar lately–with a knowing glance at that.

  

I fumbled my words quite severely, as I wasn’t expecting to speak of it right at that moment, but whatever I said correctly conveyed that Astar and I are now partners as well. He was very happy, albeit unsurprised–and teased me about it. With love, of course! I stated that I’d spare Kitah the mushy details, to which [[Mirah]] (who had been hiding behind the couch the whole while) sprouted up and demanded to hear them… Before laughing it off, leaving us to our “brotherly bonding moment” (her words) and walking off to take care of [[Sockrates]].

  

Her phrasing gave me pause–brotherly? I thought out loud about it, about which Kitah and I agreed that we’ve come to see each other as family. I felt honoured to be considered like a brother to him in some ways. We talked about our hopes for the future, and how improving the world with our loved ones will result in greater memories than simply living quietly with them. Especially as the former is what [[Uvuko]]’s teachings are all about.

  

This, however, led to Kitah sharing some grief regarding his sister’s death, and having trouble accepting it. Kitah had clearly been keeping these sentiments inside for quite some time, but he told me that he felt I was easy to open up to–and so he had. He cried it out for a bit as I comforted him, rubbing my hand down his back and offering whatever advice I could. 

  

I tried not to make it too much of a sermon, but I hope I was able to express that I was proud of him for opening up, and how this is what will lead to processing and accepting his trauma in time. I wouldn’t consider myself much of a mental health expert, but I still believe in these principles.

  

After I’d made sure he was feeling better and we assured each other that we’re always there for each other, I offered to prepare breakfast for Kitah as he washed his face. And, of course, there’s only one answer he could have given.
