##### Kitah:
It started out as a pretty normal day... if not a particularly nice one, since I got to spend it with [[Eilun]]. It was a free day for us, so [[Mirah]] and I decided it was a great time for us to visit [[Dayspring]] again and catch up on our performances. I'd realized Eilun hadn't actually gotten to watch us dance yet, so I brought it up with Mirah at breakfast... or more accurately, she'd already read my mind and knew I wanted to invite him along. Am I really that much of an open book...?

##### Mirah:
Yeah, bro, you kind of are... but honestly? I like it a lot more than when you used to try to keep all your worries to yourself. You weren't even that good at hiding it, so I could always tell when something was on your mind...

Anyway, so we went and asked Eilun if he wanted to join us. He was reading in the library, as usual. Kitah looked a little guilty for cutting into his reading time, but they were both clearly more than excited at the prospect of spending the day together. In fact, while we were walking to Dayspring, I noticed them slow their pace a little bit while [[Sockrates]] and I walked ahead. I didn't have to turn around to figure out they must have been holding hands and giggling together or something, heheh...

##### Kitah:
Oh shut up, Mirah, that's not fair... Can't I enjoy a nice walk with my boyfriend without you teasing me about it?

##### Mirah:
Alright, alright... I don't mean to be mean, you two are just really cute together... Plus, y'all are very fun to tease, hah!

##### Kitah:
Hmph... anyway, we arrived at Dayspring. As we were about to enter the [[Bites for Knights]] tavern, Eilun offered to treat me to lunch. I retorted and said that *I* would be the one to treat him this time, since he's always feeding me and giving me treats... He stood his ground and insisted though, so I relented. Then he got all smug and declared that he "won"... it's a side of him I've been starting to see more often as of late, and it's really cute...

We entered the tavern, and I was surprised when the tavernkeep greeted us as warmly as he did. Apparently, he recognized us from when we dealt with the [[Sahagin|Sahagins]] hiding underneath the town. He introduced himself as [[Alexander]], then offered to give us our meal for free! I was a little embarrassed to take advantage of his generosity, but he insisted, so we weren't gonna say no. I did hold myself back from ordering too much, though... didn't wanna abuse his kindness, after all.

We took our time to enjoy our lunch. Eilun, once again, couldn't quite finish his food, and asked me if I could finish it for him... of course, I couldn't say no to that, either. But then he started feeding me... I'm not sure how that looked to people, but I was enjoying every second of it, ahah...

W-well, anyway... After we finished eating, Mirah and I went up to Alexander and asked if we could perform in the tavern. He was quite happy to let us perform, and even offered to pay us! We were more used to receiving tips from the audience and weren't sure what to ask for, but then he offered us some crates of surplus food. Apparently, it was from when the Sahagins ransacked the tavern previously and business was closed for the cleanup. I - and we, presumably - were more than happy to accept that.

We got on the stage, and Mirah unexpectedly made a... *grand* announcement declaring our status as [[The Skybound Wanderers|Skybound Wanderers]] to the audience. I chided her for that, but I guess it wasn't a bad move to help put the guild on the map here in the [[The Outer Rim|Outer Rim]]. Anyway, we did a few of our usual routines, and our performance was received pretty warmly by the townsfolk. I've gotten used to the audience applause by now, but seeing Eilun cheering over at our table kinda just... felt different, y'know? 

Alexander approached us as we got off the stage, impressed by our dancing. He thanked us for our performance, as it was a different sight for the people of Dayspring. I had to admit too, there was a warmer, cozier vibe to performing in this quiet, Outer Rim town compared to the busier - and sometimes sleazier - cities in mainland [[Neralmia]]. 

He enthusiastically offered to have the crates of food delivered to [[Dawnhearth]], which we appreciated; I'm sure Eilun would have offered to carry them back himself and exhausted himself in the process, hah. Thinking of the guild, I also asked Alexander if he knew anyone who might be able to help us out with our settlement building efforts. He offered to help us get in touch with a local lumberjack to help supply wood to the guild! I'll be sure to let the guild know.

##### Mirah:
After we finished our business at Bites for Knights, we decided to hang around the town for a little more, since we were already here anyway. Passing by the well, I thought of how funny it was that we wouldn't have found the fish guys and saved the town if Paracelsus hadn't decided to explore the well for whatever reason. 

That thought reminded me... how are the guys we arrested doing? [[Squalho]] seemed pretty chill when he told us about [[Maa'na Lhor]], and as for *that* guy... I dunno, something told me there might be a chance for him to like, reform? He seemed kinda different after we took the conch away from him...

I looked at Kitah, and I knew we shared the same thoughts. We saw [[Gavin]] at the prison and asked to see Maa'na Lhor. The guy was strangely quiet and looked defeated... For a bit, I thought he'd lost that, um, evil fire in him, but then he snarled and tried to grab at me when I approached his cell. I guess he's still bitter... Still, it feels like something in him's different... It's a shame we couldn't really talk to him. Maybe Isaac can translate for us if he comes along next time.

Gavin also expressed some concern about Squalho. After all, the poor guy'd basically been taken far away from his home and was now just sitting in a cell, even though they were taking better care of him after his cooperation. They wanted to take him back to the [[The Tidelands|Tidelands]], but... isn't that like, on the opposite side of the Outer Rim? It'd be one heck of an inconvenient boat ride for them... So we offered to check in with [[Furiko]] and see if maybe we could help out, and take him with us whenever we return to [[Risedon]]! The fishy seemed far more amenable than the other guy, anyway... Gavin seemed grateful, and we promised to stay in touch about it.

##### Kitah:
Eilun seemed a bit confused as to why we were concerned with Maa'na Lhor - understandably so, since he'd just tried to control his fellow Sahagins and raise an army to take over the world. And, well... I just think everyone deserves a chance, y'know? Even the worst people almost always are how they are for a reason... definitively judging people before knowing the whole story never sits well with me. Maybe we could hear his story, learn why he did what he did... and maybe even convince him to change. Or maybe not, but at least we gave him the chance... I'm not sure I explained it all that well to Eilun, but he seemed to understand, and nodded.

We got back to Dawnhearth in the middle of the afternoon. I'd really enjoyed my time out with Eilun, but, well... I still wanted to spend time with him. I asked to join him in the library, maybe see what he's been reading up on and try to read some stuff myself. Admittedly, I found myself dozing off after a while... n-not that I was bored! Eilun's presence was just very calming, plus the quiet yet cozy atmosphere in our library... Fortunately, it seems I don't snore too loud, and managed not to drool on my picture book.

Later that night, Eilun told me the living room would be empty for us to use, so we decided to chill there together for the evening. We didn't have our own rooms yet, so for the time being it was probably the best we'd get for privacy.

##### Mirah:
Ahh... this is *that* part, right? I don't wanna snoop into your private business, so I'll leave you to it, bro. Sockrates and I will be waiting for ya!

##### Kitah:
Thanks, Mirah, I appreciate that. Yeah... the night started off nice and lovely, me and Eilun cuddling up to each other on the couch with only the cozy glow of the fireplace watching us. But, well... I couldn't stop the thoughts that'd been gnawing at me from bubbling up. I love Eilun and never want to let him go, but... he came here from another time period. The people he must have left behind... did he miss them? Did they miss him? Did he ever... want to go back...?

Thoughts like that had been swimming around the back of my head for a while. I was terrified he'd answer "yes" to all of those... I didn't want to lose him, but neither did I want to make him stay if he really wanted to go back...

I guess it must have showed on my face, because Eilun asked me what was wrong. After a deep breath, I told him what was on my mind, and asked if he ever wanted to return to the time he came from.

There was a period of silence before he finally responded. He regretted leaving everyone behind at first, terrified of being all alone in what became a totally unfamiliar place to him... But, he also didn't feel loved back where he came from. His parents only made him feel used, only good for what he could do rather than for who he was. It was why he ran away, after all... and in the end, he's been far happier being himself with the guild and, well, with me.

His response left me feeling... sad. Conflicted. It was heartbreaking to know that's how he felt about his family. And, well... what must they have thought when he disappeared? I thought back to myself, when Mirah died... I felt so lost, and purposeless. I... genuinely wondered if it'd have been better for me to join her in the stars, than to try to live on without her. And thinking of what those he left behind must have thought... I felt selfish for wanting to hold on to him.

But in the end, it was all about Eilun's choice. It's not for me to decide what's best for him and where he'd like to be. And despite some of those nagging thoughts... I was *so* relieved he wanted to stay. I... just can't bear the thought of losing him... I couldn't hold my tears back as I begged him never to leave me. The tears flowed from his eyes, too, as he promised to stay, and that we'd make beautiful memories together, with all our friends, to put down in that book of his to for us to look back on and remember. I told him, I wouldn't need a book to remember him forever...

...Sorry, it was a rather emotional night for me. I finally had the nerve to tell him, concretely, that I loved him. I mean, it was obvious and we all knew it, but this was the first time I ever said the words out loud... and he didn't hesitate to say them back to me. Then I pulled him in for a kiss... then another... then another... I'm not sure how long we kissed each other that night, but it simultaneously felt like forever, and nowhere near long enough.

The rest of the night was kind of a blur to me, honestly. We stayed like that in each other's embrace, and Eilun said something about wanting to share a room eventually, which I agreed to without a second thought, then we fell asleep, me spooning him.

When I woke up that morning, Eilun was still sound asleep. He looked so cute sleeping and I didn't want to wake him up... But he stayed asleep for quite a while, and eventually my rumbling tummy must have woken him up... I'd stayed with him on the couch til lunchtime, and I was absolutely starving from having skipped breakfast. It was worth it to get to hold him like that for longer, though... 

I wondered why nobody had come in to check on us, since we'd been alone in the living room for so long. But considering Mirah was the one who eventually did, I realized she must have told everyone else not to disturb us. She'd even gotten our lunch ready for us when we eventually got up. She really does have my back...
