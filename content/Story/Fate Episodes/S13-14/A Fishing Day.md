Dayspring is such a nice place to relax. Me and [[Mori]] were visiting the place to take a break after the incident caused by the Sahagins. I had a fun thought in mind and visited [[Buko]] along with [[Mori]] and it turns out he was about to fish as well. I asked if me and [[Mori]] could accompany him and try my paw on fishing since I've... never really done it before. And they said it was okay!

But before we departed, [[Chuji]] , [[Xayamynx]] and [[Akira]] walked into us! We invited them to fishing since it could be fun to have more people around! I haven't gotten to meet [[Chuji]] personally and it was nice to formally introduce myself to him and I heard he's good at playing music! Need to hear them play sometime.

After a long walk, we arrived at the fishing spot where [[Buko]] usually sits by to fish. It was a pretty nice sight, you could even see Dayspring from where we stood! We were handed fishing tackles and he taught us how to attach a lure for the fishes. [[Xayamynx]] and [[Akira]] were... having some complications and tied themselves with the fishing rope in the process.. And afterwards, we casted our lures towards the river and played the waiting game.

[[Buko]] asked us about our hometown "Bandle City", which resides in the Dream World. Told them about what it's like and the folks around it. And especially the importance of being united and social to keep the soul of Bandle City happy. 

In turn, he talked to us about Payapania. A land with multiple lands, huh? People using elemental magic in activities they see fit? Now that's something I'm pretty intrigued to look at for myself! In fact, he performed a trick right in front of us! Who knew someone could manipulate water with the movement of their very being? I was wrapping my head on the idea of such magic when suddenly, [[Buko]] and [[Mori]] had tugs on their lures! Fishes I've never seen before aside from those you usually see. A peculiar jellyfish and a distinguishable color on a fish?

And on top of that, it was already the afternoon. Well, it's about to be the evening, so we decided to wrap the fishing trip up... But I got a tug on my lure! It was a silly looking fish that was looking at me funny and apparently, it was a rare find! I decided to keep it and name it "Isda" in [[Buko]]'s suggestion, which means fish in the Payapanian language. With a happy find, we were finally set to go back home.

I gotta thank [[Buko]] for sharing some stuff about his home. It makes me rather curious whether there's some books related to Payapania around here?
