Auguest 4, 3E 1564

<p class="xaya">Written by Xayamynx (with assistance from various guildmates)</p>

On this day we ~~reveicd~~ received a mission from a client with the name [[Paul Bunman|Pol Bunmun]]. He says that he need help ~~bring~~ escorting a cilent of his to [[Hazelport|Hazel Port]]. The client in question is a member from the [[Brighthammer Thieves Guild|Thiefs Guild]] but turn rog and is being hunted by that guild. Our task is to escort him safely so that he can be ~~tried~~ trialed under Pol's case. Me, [[Rook|Ruk]] and [[Akira]] took the mission.

We arive at [[Hollybrook Fields|Holy Book Farm]] far from [[Dawnhearth|Dawn Hearth]] using a ~~carryag~~ carriage where we met up with [[Barron Stoneheart|Boaris]] who was housing Pol's client safely in the granery. There we found our escort and his name is [[Shadowblade|Shellblade]]. He says that when he run away the Thiefs Guild poison him with [[Black Lotus Poison|a scary chemical that uses a black lotus]]. I think   if we can find a way to get this poison we can maybe try to make a antivenom? Because Shellblade cannot move in his state we must bring him with a carriage. But Pol says that because of his ~~rebe~~ ~~repotato~~ reputation he cannot travel with us. To me tough I think he is trying to escape fighting.

When we leave the farm Shellblade ask us to take a differend route in case we are ambush. But on the way we got ambush any way by two asasins from the ~~th~~ Thiefs Guild and two dogs. The fight was hard but we prevailed in the end and success fully made it to ~~h~~ Hazel Port.

We reunited with Pol. said our goodbye and watch as Pol and Shellblade left the Port on ship. ~~This~~ Thus concludes our mission.

###### OOC Summary (for Nico to write about if she wishes)
- a couple days after well exploration and retrieval of conch
- paul bunmann visits SW guild
- rook answers door, and asks for help with an escort mission - a client from the thieves guild is turning themselves in, and needs to be escorted to hazelport safely. however, there may be danger afoot and so here he is
- akira happened to be at the front, and volunteers for the job, rook too
- they discuss a little amongst themself to see if they wanna get xaya in on this, and checks in with furiko on it
- nvm furiko is asleep, they decide to ask xaya directly
- xaya excitedly accepts, but a little too hyper and others ask to tone it down. paul doubts xaya but trusts her anyway
- one carriage ride to a farm way out of dayspring later, they speak to the owner of the farm, barron stoneheart
- paul speaks to barron about his client, and barron leads the gang to the grainery where shadowblade is taking refuge
- shadowblade explains that he defected from the thieves guild and is under a crippling poison involving a black lotus (note: link it in the website later)
- paul dips because he needs to sit out because he has an image to uphold
- so now the gang has to ride a carriage (bought from barron) to the destination... but no one is high on nature except xaya (oh dear)
- after feeding the horse and a bit of struggle, the gang gets moving ever so slowly
- shadowblade recommends to take a detour because the main route may have ambushes
- gang passes by badlands that appear to be devoid of colour... shadowblade mentions that no man should ever enter this place
- halfway on the journey, akira notices something on the bridge and gets off...
- xaya and rook, looking in the direction of akira, notices a shadow lurking in the distance! an ambush!
- a cheetah rogue from the thieves guild strides forth, blowing a whistle to call forth two dogs, combat ensues!
- halfway into the battle, the rogue blows the whistle again, calling another thieves guild rogue into the battle!
- - one dog is knocked out by rook, and the cheetah rogue is shot in the neck by akira
- the other dog runs away, seeing that both his friend and master is gone
- the last rogue (which took A LOT OF TIME FIGHTING BTW because of poor luck) beats xaya up quite a bit, grabs onto her and demands for shadowblade
- akira and rook attempts diplomacy but fails
- xaya breaks free and lands the finishing blow, albeit quite banged up
- the group rests for 20 minutes to recuperate. xaya asks shadowblade if all thieves guild members were this hostile, to which he replies yes
- the gang continues their journey to hazelport without any further complications. They find Paul and escort shadowblade to him, where they take a boat to ekron for his trial. Paul promises that his sentence will be as lenient as he can make it
- and so the mission is a wrap!
- wait the carriage. Barron's horse. Uhhhh-
- the gang decides to keep it in dawnhearth for now and unwind.
- they return to soothing tunes from the bard chuji :D
- rook and akira asks xaya about what she thought about today's mission, but she seemed rather out of it, acknowledging it and then excusing herself immediately
- rook and akira briefly catch up before reporting the mission to furiko
- akira quickly checks on xaya real quick given her uncharacteristic behaviour, and finds her slumped on the table
- xaya jumped as akira appeared, still a little on edge, but softens up a little when akira told her that she thinks that xaya did a good job today, and she will relay this to furiko
- xaya thanks her sheepishly (but still with doubt)
- akira returns to rook and furiko to discuss the reward paul left - an upgrade for akira's gun and an altemian dictionary for xaya, as well as 60gp in total! They also discuss about xaya's performance and the upcoming hunters festival
- in the meantime, xaya approaches astar about why he became a skybound wanderer
- day ends as the group get together for soup
