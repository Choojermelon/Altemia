Ah, I rarely get to venture so far off from [[Risedon]]. A few moons ago I received a request from [[Furiko]] to assist in the endeavours of the guild once more. This time it seems that they’ll be headed to the outer rim! Fascinating, and possibly terrifying. Truth be told my library has scant knowledge of the outer rim, this is a perfect opportunity to create a few volumes of my own to add to the archives.  
  
Upon the dawn of day I said goodbye to cosmic magic-infused hands, [[Calypso]] & [[Mackenzie]] (Maybe I should not name them… oh well). I befriended them at the last outing with the guild. I fear they will be up to mischief in my absence, but I’m sure the rest of the library staff will be fine.  
  
After getting everything ready I made my way towards [[Ekron]], the nearby port where the adventure would begin in earnest. I met with [[Furiko]] and assisted the guild with loading the ship with the investment of a crystal I got previously. I met up with [[Akira]] again! And to my pleasure, they seem to be doing well! They have a little buddy too!  
  
After learning the circumstances surrounding [[Akira]]’s new companion I can only feel at a loss for the poor separated family. I’m glad that [[Akira]] is being accountable for her actions. It seems the type of bear [[Akira]] faced wasn’t violent or hunting for sport. They are territorial, so they must have been displaced from their natural habitat... It might be best to inform [[Furiko]] regarding that, or the city officials, as this is doomed to be repeated.  
  
The Voyage by boat was rather... uneventful, which is good. I had ample time to catch up on reading; everyone was minding their own business, so I finished “Being and Time” Ah... what a fascinating book.  
  
Upon our arrival at the port of [[Hazelport]], I breathe in to take in the fresh air; a welcome change of pace from the salty breeze of the voyage. [[Furiko]] kindly asked me to arrange matters with the customs office and Akira came along. (I’m genuinely surprised they have those over here! What kind of stuff do they get?). [[Akira]]’s bear cub decided to follow us along, and to my pleasure, I’ll do what I can to keep the little one comfortable. After some more talking, [[Akira]] named the bear [[Freddy]]. What a cute name!  
  
I was able to have a most joyful chat with the attendant of the customs office; the paperwork was swiftly sorted out and then even entertained my thirst for knowledge of the new region!  
  
I received a map and a few interesting pointers. The nearby settlements are smaller than what I’ve grown accustomed to back home, but the closest settlement out of the forest works well with wood. Perhaps [[Furiko]] will commission a lot of new furniture from there! There is a second settlement past it slightly to the north. It is the largest settlement nearby. On the edge of the map by the north, another settlement handles metal and stone with unique expertise! What a lively region!  
  
Before I left the lady warned me of a few things, it came down to:  
  
 **D O  N O T   S T R A Y   F R O M   T H E   P A T H S    I N    T H E   F O R E S T**  
  
  

  

Apparently, the local flora and fauna of the region are… hostile; the roads are safe because given how frequently they are traveled we have good odds of receiving help. Most Fauna have adapted around the routes and, in response, know better than to pick a fight or hunt in the forest’s trails.  
  
After a long walk to the Guild’s new manor [[Akira]], [[Furiko]] and I finally arrive. The place has seen better days but I understand the vision behind this; there is a lot of Potential. [[Astar]] is kind enough to give myself and [[Akira]] a tour around the place meanwhile [[Furiko]] and the others unload the carriages of goods and resources we have brought from [[Ekron]]. We also got an explanation of what the current priorities are! [[Akira]], upon hearing that the sanitary facilities of the manor were not functional, immediately sprang into action. It seems that [[Furiko]] wants to take up gardening for the guild to be more self-sufficient. I’ve read a few books regarding the matter so I believe I might be able to provide some assistance.  
  
To my delight, the manor has a library!!! The books here are in terrible to poor condition; but thankfully, as a Librarian I am prepared to restore books. With a spell, I’ve cast well over a thousand times: mending, I can restore these books, with the caveat that I can only manage a few castings of this spell per day.  
  
The book I recovered while I first visited the library in the tour given by [[Astar]] details the local fauna around the region and in my free time, I decided to read it. This place does not mess around; it’s funny to ponder: what does living on a fallen moon do to the ecosystem…?  
  
I found a specially concerning Entry of a so-called Great Jaggi; it looks like it belongs to the Raptor family and is the leader of packs of smaller creatures. With the ability to call upon their pack, they swarm and overwhelm enemies and prey with impressive intelligence. With an impressive speed-to-size ratio they can leap aggressively all over the place; be quick on their feet and never stay still for long.  
  
I will bring it up and inform the rest during dinner or breakfast.
