[[Kitah]] and I decided to try our hand at some performances around the city, and it went well! Like, really, really well! We even managed to impress the grumpy barkeep at [[The Bitter Druid]] and, uh… the old lady running [[The Tired Knight’s Inn]]? Not sure why [[Kitah]] decided on dancing for her... Oh, and we checked up on [[Reinald]] after his night of drowning his sorrows in drink. I’m sure he’ll be fine, in time.

Anyway! We might be great dancers, heh, but versed in magic, we’re not. We’ve still gotta figure out how all this happened and how I’m like… here in the first place. We went to the library and read up on what little we could about starlight magic… Okay, [[Kitah]] read up on it. But he told me after! We borrowed another book about the universe’s creation, or something, then paid a visit to the [[Temple of the Astral Dragon]]. While there, I caught the eye of a shy little cat. I know it’s because I’m a starlight phantom, but I’d like to think my looks had something to do with it too… Turns out the kitty, [[Eilun]], was from the guild AND also training in starlight magic! Hopefully we’ll be able to help each other out, and become great friends while we’re at it!
