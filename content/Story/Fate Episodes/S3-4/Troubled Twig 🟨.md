I made the acquaintance of Astar of the guild, who is honestly a delightful presence. Agreed to help Furiko with a book retrieval errand as well. On the way back, I encountered Mr Twig, who seemed out of sorts. After tracking down a druid named Kloros to interpret, we learned that Mr Twig had been separated from Brom, who seemed to be down in the sewers…  

Also met Eilun, a young man who isn't much for talking but seems to appreciate a good book. Maybe something we could talk about in the future.  
  
Kitah, Mirah and Astar aided me in tracking Brom down. We dispatched the bandits living in the sewer and got Brom safely out of there. He promises to find a safer line of work in the future to pay for Mr. Twig’s sustenance. Speaking of, Mr. Twig seems rather attached to me now! Kloros then gives us our next job as a guild–to escort him to the Kharsis Swamplands. I will be sure to inform the rest of our little group here.

That same night, a guild member named Paracelsus approached me about his mysterious artificial heart–a Philosopher’s Stone, he says! According to our local magic shop clerk (who has taken quite a liking to the guy, mind you), she might be able to help. Astar also suggested we seek out the witch of the swamp, if she’s kind enough to lend her knowledge. I intend to strike a deal with her using a reagent called Mudsworth. I also bought some gifts for Astar and Eilun, which they quite liked! I’m enjoying their friendship.

Finally, I investigated this blood-red ruby we found in the swamp. It’s connected to the Chalice of Blight, which I have been seeking to neutralise for some time now. Mori tells me the Red Moon Cult seeks to bring back Imeron, the dark dragon, that he might restore the long-lost red moon with which they are obsessed. He suspects they might be using either Void or Nightmare magic, but isn't sure which one.

Throughout the week, I gave religious sermons on Uvuko in Risedon. They were a huge success! It was suggested that one of the parables I told be adapted into a stage play in the months to come. I’m not much of a performer, but I do like to entertain…
