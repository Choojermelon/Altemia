After a few days from completing our first mission, I decided to go to the library to learn more about dark magics that could help me understand the means and their sources of power. I learned from there that there are certain magics called Nightmares and Void. It could be related to how those cultists were able to manifest those horrendous beings that attacked us from our visit to the Alryne Ruins. 

  

Once I had my fill of knowledge with the dark magics, I read through their histories and how they were found and how they came to be. I stumbled upon the history of the [[Red Moon Cult]]. The very same people who emerged and attacked us. It turns out that their name came from the title of a Dragon that was supposed to “rightfully rule the world”, so they serve and worship Imeron, the Red Moon Dragon. And to do so, they kidnap people. Assuming that they are made offerings or sacrifices to their damn god.

  

Afterwards, I saw a figure that looked like [[Bertea]]. Foolishly, I followed him, only to be lured by my inner demon’s trap. Merely to remind me of my time in this body of “theirs” and torment me. Had I been smarter not to fall for such a trick. I went back to the guild in a sorry state and decided to take a rinsing. And honestly, a fresh bath was one thing I definitely needed. And jobs in [[Risedon]] to distract me from my burdens. And to end my day, I… don’t remember everything, but… I do recall drinking.
