I woke up in a dirty cell after being knocked out by [[The Jailer]] from the bridge. Speaking of, [[Mori]] fell down the river.. I hope he’s alright. Or even alive. It didn’t look like a very safe river to fall from. I didn’t see anywhere I could go besides just waltzing around the cell with a mean looking guard just right outside the cell, so I let time pass by. And, oh boy, everything just became so dire so fast, I’m not sure what to do.

  

I felt a dribble of rain fall on my head and noticed an opening on the ceiling, in which I opened even more. But as I tried to escape, my arms failed me and the guard caught me. And let’s just say I… paid for my actions… with a beating. I was taken to a different room, tossed even. I was so thirsty and rain was pouring from the ceiling again. At that point, I had no choice but to drink the rain water. Yuck. Is all I can say. But it was better than nothing.

  

After more time had passed, the same cultist guy that kidnapped me entered my cell and interrogated me. I still denied anything I knew about the book, which has been revealed as ‘Maledictum’, besides telling them that me and [[Mori]] tossed the book away. And afterwards, I was considered useless or worthless. Instead, I’m going to be used as a test subject. [[The Jailer]] pulled out a syringe and injected a substance on me.

  

To test if I become ‘one of them’. He left afterwards, only to leave me alone and suffer under the effect of his syringe. I passed out and began having nightmares upon nightmares upon n-nightmares… I woke up and.. I thought I was dead. Left hungry… thirsty… helpless… seeing the rain water, I tried to crawl onto it… but I couldn’t, just… paralyzed down on the ground to watch the rats drink up the water in front of me, much to my dismay. And then… everything afterwards was just a blur to me, except the nightmares again as I passed out… I don’t know what to do anymore…  

  

[[Mori]]… please… help me.
