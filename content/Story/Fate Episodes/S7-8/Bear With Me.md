Where to even begin with this one? I suppose the beginning, huh? I was sitting in the [[The Skybound Wanderers|guild]] hall, eating soup and minding my business, when this guy approached me out of nowhere, seemingly having an interest in me. His name was [[Kasparr]], and he asked me questions while introducing himself pompously...I hadn't met anyone who was quite as self-absorbed as him thus far, and I fear he'd burst if he was any more full of himself.

Our chat was interrupted when an otter bard by the name of [[Chuji]] stepped in, he is rather fascinating with his lute that looks like a watermelon! He was accompanied by a dog champion named [[Rydel]], and the two of them told us that there was a Grizzly outside the city boundaries wreaking havoc - hunting animals and people alike. I'm not one to turn down helping the populace, even though I have a...distaste for magic, so both Kasparr and I agreed to help (he appointed himself as leader of this undertaking). 

Not knowing what we'd get ourselves into or where to start, we made some preparations and inquisitions, during which Chuji proved that he had his way with people. There was this shopkeep who feigned memory loss and suggested some coin as a remedy, but my otter companion buttered him up with honeyed words and made him talk without payment...now I'm kinda hungry. Anyway, we procured some deer meat as possible bait as well, and set out into the forest where the bear was supposedly hunting.

Kasparr took the lead and indeed delivered us unto a clearing where the animal was sleeping. And by the Gods, that thing was *huge*! We saw our advantage in the bear sleeping and us being atop a cliff, so I, as the designated markswoman, hit it while it was unaware. Chuji helped me hold my barrel steady, and I delivered a mighty and devastating blow to the Grizzly. Not quite enough to take it out unfortunately, and judging by the reaction I made it mighty pissed off as well. 

The reaction in question was it storming to the cliff we were on and climbing it without trouble, followed by charging at us. Chuji sang supporting and invigorating hymns to encourage us while I shot it again and wounded it further, but its assault was relentless and unstoppable as it ran straight at me and hit me hard before grappling me. I luckily snapped my head out of the way as it tried to crush it in its jaw, and Kasparr came to my aid and brought the frenzied animal down with some lightning. Yeah, of course the most annoying person I had ever met *also* had magical abilities, who would have guessed?

Rydel patched me up as I wrested myself from the grip of the deceased bear, I suppose I owe Kasparr one for saving my life. We then went to investigate the clearing the bear had been sleeping in, and regret hit me quite soon after. I learned a lesson of gathering as much intel as possible before taking action, because in a tree stump we found a [[Freddy|bear cub]]. Seems the bear had been a mother and we took it away from this cub. 

Feeling guilty about this (which Kasparr encouraged by reminding me I played the biggest part in killing the bear, asshole), I consulted with the others on how to proceed and we agreed on asking [[Furiko]] about it. We took the bear to the edge of the city and Rydel stayed behind while Chuji, Kasparr and I went to speak with the guild master. Supposedly, according to Furiko, it would be for the best to either adopt the bear (which is tied to enormous paperwork) or to release it back into the wilderness in its natural habitat.

Kasparr threw in that he has a [[Kloros|druid friend]] who he could ask for advice on the matter, and promised he'd fetch him soon to help me with this. Truth be told, I don't think I'm quite capable of caring for a cub? Like, I'm able to care for myself but I'm barely holding my mind together at the moment...anyway, Chuji threw in that the bear could find temporary accommodation at the sawmill I [[Milling some Bandits|helped liberate]] some weeks ago so it wouldn't be in the city, and we agreed it'd be for the best.

Kasparr, Chuji and I returned to Rydel, where we apprised him of the situation. Chuji then offered up a limerick for Kasparr (he got what he deserved, Chuji has a way with words) before the investigator fellow went his way. The other two stayed behind to watch the bear while I went to the sawmill and explained my situation to its owner. He was understanding and still thankful for my timely intervention back then, so they agreed to let me and the bear stay over for a while, and I'd help with work around there as well to make up for it.

It was already very late by the time I returned to the others, they had even made a campfire. Seeing as how the sawmill was a few hours away from the city, we decided to camp for the night. Curiously enough...they had been playing UNO, the three of them, and the bear was winning?? As soon as I stepped in I won a round though, which made the cub kinda upset...not for long though, it won the next round. Beaten by a bear at a game of cards, whaddayaknow.

We went to sleep soon after, and after an uneventful night Rydel had to excuse himself to take care of stuff, so I was going to go to the sawmill by myself. Chuji kindly offered to accompany me, which I was happy about, and so we safely saw the cub to the place without any problems or interruptions. We parted ways there, and it dawned upon me that I'd be, at east for the foreseeable future, be a foster mom after all...
