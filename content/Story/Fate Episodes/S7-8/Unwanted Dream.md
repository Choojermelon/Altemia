I’ve been thinking about [[Bertea]] lately, which has made me grow rather nervous about our infiltration. Worried that it will turn out bad for the rest of us. And maybe worse, even for [[Bertea]]. It’s the middle of the night and I haven’t been able to sleep, drinking and drinking, hopefully knocking me out, or even to drift me away from my tears and worries. And things decided it would make my day even worse, I dreamt about my abrupt parting with [[Bertea]].

We crossed an unsafe bridge with no signs of alternate routes to take for the better. Only to be caught in a pincer attack by the cultists. The very same ones we encountered from Alryne Ruins. They ask for the Maledictum and both of us tried to play it off that we are unknown of its existence, but it was failing miserably. I felt bad for [[Bertea]], having to involve him with my actions.

They ask for it to the point where they’ve gone far as to take [[Bertea]] hostage. I couldn’t let him come to harm and gave up. But since I was being held and tossed down on the bridge, it gave out and I fell down the river with a high tide. And that was the last time I saw [[Bertea]]. 

When I woke up, the Maledictum was right in front of me. As I came to, I called for [[Bertea]], only to be responded by the chirps of the birds and the bristling sound of the tree leaves. As I picked up the Maledictum, I noticed a gold coin. It was [[Bertea]]’s. And since then, it has been my good luck charm, hoping it would lead me to him. And as if… he never left me.

I woke up to the sun, just about rising up from the clouds. The lights begin to light up from the windows and everyone slowly wakes up and walks around the Hall. I opened the Maledictum again after being basically untouched for a long time. After all that has happened so far, I am desperate to save [[Bertea]] with everything I could learn and what power I can even wield. I just hope I didn’t make a bad decision.
