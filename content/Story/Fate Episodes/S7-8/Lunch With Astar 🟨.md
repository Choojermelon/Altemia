I’ve been running myself ragged lately, figuring out how our fortress infiltration is going to function and making the necessary preparations. Today was a much-needed respite from all of that, and gave me the opportunity to know a couple of dear friends better as well.

  

Astar kindly provided me with breakfast at the guild, having worked diligently on the soup recipe using ingredients gathered by our own adventurers. I found some time to read that Ushii translation book Kloros gave us, as well; if I keep this up, maybe I’ll be able to speak with Mister Twig! The leshy language is so different from our own.

  

After eating, Astar suggested that he’d like to get to know me a bit better, and asked if we could go on a walk around town! I gleefully accepted (whilst keeping a straight face…) and he took me to the docks in the East Trade District. We tried fishing with our bare paws, of all things! I didn’t expect to jump into the water today, but it was a refreshing experience, and I somehow managed to catch more fish than my dear friend! He was impressed and suggested I partake in the annual fishing competition should I ever visit his homeland.

  

We released the fish, and the guy treated me to lunch as well! He seemed to take quite an active interest in knowing more about me, from asking about my companions to my past and homeland. I couldn’t tell him much about the latter, but I hope to tell him (or perhaps show him), once all this Chalice business is over and done with.

  

Back at the guild, we spoke to Eilun who gave me a novel (The Cleric’s Return) in return for what I had gifted him. Why, that warmed my heart right through, seeing him continue to open up a bit and feel more comfortable. Astar and I relaxed in his room a bit as I read said book–until he passed out, anyway! It was lovely to spend the day with him, and got me to think about my own hobbies some more.

  

Finally, I spent dinnertime with Kitah and Mirah. They, too, wanted to know more of my past, and I felt compelled to reveal a few things. Probably due to that captivating dance they showed me as we were talking! Perhaps I will also show those two a slice of my home when I am able.
