*Gathering in the kitchen, Astar lays out the plan for the group to explore the Wandering Woods to gather useful materials for rebuilding Dawnhearth*

*Many hands make light work, so they check if anyone else is around who can help*

*Rydel and Xayamynx are in the main hall; Rydelâ€™s busy with tasks but Xaya can accompany the group*

*They make their way to the Wandering Woods, and Astar takes off on his own to gather wood*

*The rest split up to cover more ground; Kitah and Eilun go together, Mirah accompanies Xaya, and Bertea searches on his own*

*Xaya finds some brown mushrooms, and suggests that darker, duller mushrooms are usually safer while brightly colored ones are dangerous, but isnâ€™t sure*

*Mirah findsâ€¦ a worm with a funny face :) She quickly grows attached as she lets it climb onto her ethereal form, somehow*

*Bertea runs into a tooth fairy, who offers knowledge about useful and dangerous plants in the area in exchange for one of his teeth*

*Bertea, after much hesitation, agrees; heâ€™s in pain for a while as his tooth is pulled, but the fairy does deliver with the agreed info, which Bertea notes down*

*Eilun finds some herbs that are particularly good for brewing an energizing tea, and offers to make Kitah some sometime*

*Kitah and Eilun inspect the trees to figure out which ones are good for cutting down, though neither of them are particularly knowledgeable there; they eventually settle on a larger, sturdy-looking tree*

*Kitah takes a few swings with an axe and makes headway, then Eilun, eager to help out, attempts to swing the axe but lacks the strength for it*

*Kitah comforts him and finishes the job*

*They cut the wood into smaller pieces to carry, aided by Eilunâ€™s Swift spell, then regroup with the others*

*Mirah introduces her worm friend, who sheâ€™s named Sockrates; the rest are worried he might be dangerous but she pleads that he isnâ€™t*

*Sockrates suddenly lets out a deafening scream; Kitah and Mirah are unaffected, but the rest are momentarily deafened*

*Eilun muses that Sockrates must be a singer worm; they can be trained to sing songs, but in the wild only know how to make weird noises*

*Everyone else is apprehensive, but Mirah pleads ðŸ¥º with them to let her keep him, to which they relent*

*Astar returns and everyone shows what theyâ€™ve gathered before making their way back to Dawnhearth*

*Astar and Kitah intend to shoulder most of the wood, but Eilun insists on helping carry some*

*As soon as they reach Dawnhearth, Eilun drops to the ground exhausted*

*Kitah carries Eilun into the manor so heâ€™s not laying down outside*

*Mirah asks Bertea if he can make a pacifier to keep Sockrates from screaming until they train him*

*The group unloads their haul and more supplies from a carriage, before having dinner together*
