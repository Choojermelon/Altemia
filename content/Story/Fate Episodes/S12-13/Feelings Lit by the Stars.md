*After finishing up in the underground well caverns, the party decides to take a break from their tasks and do their own thing*

*[[Eilun]] invites [[Kitah]] to join him and visit the peak of a nearby mountain*

*Before leaving Dayspring, [[Eilun]] suggests they have a meal at the tavern, figuring [[Kitah]] would be hungry*

*[[Eilun]] watches [[Kitah]] eat, also offering a pastry fish he made with [[Astar]]’s help, which [[Kitah]] also eats happily*

*They make their way up the [[Greenwood Mountain]]*

*[[Eilun]]’s exhausted by the climb and the thinning mountain air, so [[Kitah]] carries him up the last stretch of the climb*

*They reach the peak, where they see an abandoned, ruined shrine with a damaged statue in the middle; according to [[Eilun]], it’s a shrine to [[Zarth]], the Starlight Dragon*

*They clean up around the statue and [[Eilun]] decorates it with some flowers; meanwhile, [[Mirah]] (and [[Sockrates]]) knowingly leave the two of them alone together*

*[[Eilun]] reveals he brought them here to catch a meteor shower that happens at the end of each month, and they wait for evening*

*[[Kitah]] opens up about how he feels about life, and how [[Eilun]] helps him in more ways than the cat knows*

*After a few shy, quiet moments, [[Kitah]] pulls [[Eilun]] in for a hug, which is soon returned*

*Not long after, the meteor shower begins*

*After admiring the shooting stars for a bit, [[Eilun]] suggests they capture the memory with a [[Memoria Crystal]], and they take a picture together*

[[*Eilun]] tells [[Kitah]] about a story he’s writing about an adventurer cat named [[Zaku]], and asks him to read it as he writes more*

*The meteor shower ends and they decide to return home… but not before [[Kitah]] tells [[Mirah]] not to spread gossip about them*

*[[Eilun]] claims he’s still tired, and asks if [[Kitah]] can carry him home, to which he agrees*

*They arrive at [[Dawnhearth]], and [[Kitah]] for once is a little tired from carrying [[Eilun]] all the way home*

*Both tired, they sleep on one of the sofas together*
