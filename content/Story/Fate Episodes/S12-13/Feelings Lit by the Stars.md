##### Kitah:

Well, umm... Remember when [[A Walk with Eilun|I said Eilun was just a good friend to me]]? Yeah, haha... it's funny how feelings can grow with time. Over these past few months, I've felt myself getting closer and more affectionate with the cat. I could sense him feeling the same way too, with him being far more comfy around me compared to his nervous demeanor when we first met. And how could I forget the little snacks he'd offer me every now and then? 

Still, I hesitated to admit my true feelings about him. All this is new territory for me... I didn't want to make [[Eilun]] uncomfy, or change things between us if ever he didn't feel the same way. So I'm happy - no, to be frank, I'm absolutely *giddy* - that today went the way it did.

After our unexpected detour and encounter at the bottom of [[Dayspring]]'s well, we collectively decided to take a break and spend the rest of the day doing whatever we wanted. That was when [[Eilun]] invited me to go on a little hike up the [[Greenwood Mountain]] just outside the town. He didn't reveal why, and neither did I ask - I was just glad to get to spend more time alone with him... and [[Mirah]] too, I guess.

##### Mirah:

Hey! Don't even try to pretend you don't enjoy your sister's company, hmph... 

But anyway! Before we made our way to the mountain, [[Eilun]] suggested that we stop at the tavern for a bite first, despite the fact he wasn't even hungry! He just knew my brother would never say no to grabbing some grub... and after watching [[Kitah]] scarf down his meal, [[Eilun]] even gave him a little chocolate-filled fish pastry! I rarely get to see [[Kitah]]'s face light up the way it did then, and I could tell it was from more than just the food. I'm telling you, I saw the sparks flying between these two even before they did...

##### Kitah:

M-Mirah...

##### Mirah:

Fine, I'll just get on with it... Well, after that, we spent a few hours climbing up the mountain, which took us a few hours. Little [[Eilun]]'s far from the athletic type, so he was pretty exhausted by the last leg of the climb. Not to be rude to him or anything - in fact I'm impressed he pushed himself this far, especially given how air's thinner at mountain heights... or something like that, not like it matters to me.

Seeing how spent [[Eilun]] was, my brother offered to carry him for the final stretch, which the kitty accepted. Knowing them, and seeing their relationship now, I'm pretty sure they were both just looking for an excuse to have some close contact, hehehe...

##### Kitah:

[[Mirah]]!! I'll take it from here, now... Eventually, we reached the peak of the mountain. There, we saw a ruined shrine with a damaged statue sitting in the center. [[Eilun]] told us it was an abandoned shrine to [[Zarth]], the Starlight Dragon, and that meteor showers were said to fall at the end of every month, visible most clearly from this shrine. Actually, it was the reason he wanted me to come here with him... he wanted to catch the meteor shower and see the shooting stars together with me. I felt my heart flutter at that, and I tried to contain my excitement... though I don't think I could stop my tail wagging, aheh...

It'd still be a few hours before the stars would come out, so [[Eilun]] and I decided to busy ourselves and try to pretty up the place a bit - pay some respects to [[Zarth]], and all. In the meantime, [[Mirah]] went off on her own with [[Sockrates]]. Knowing her, she was probably trying to dodge the cleanup work, but I also knew she was giving the two of us space to enjoy each other's company. *Sigh...* She can be a handful, but I can't deny she's incredibly sensitive and considerate when she wants to be.

##### Mirah:

Aww, bro... You know I've always got your back!

##### Kitah:

Anyway, after doing what we could to fix up the shrine - [[Eilun]] even thought to place flowers by the statue, bless him - we sat down by the statue to wait for nightfall. We chatted a little here and there, but most of the time was just us sitting together quietly, comfortable in each other's presence. If I'm being honest... it was simultaneously the most relaxed and anxious I'd been in a while. I could have sat like this with [[Eilun]] forever... but the whole time, I couldn't stop thinking about whether or not I should tell him how I felt, or how I should tell him...

We stayed that way for a while, but as the sky began to dim, there was still no sign of a meteor shower after hours of waiting. [[Eilun]] began to worry that he might have read wrong, and started apologizing that we'd just wasted our time. I stopped him right there. I told him, even if we never got to see the stars, getting to spend time with him like this already made the trip more than worth it. Then I opened up a little more... about how I felt about life, about my past, and well... about him. I admitted how important he is to me, and that he helps me more than he probably knows, just by being him. 

I stopped just short of saying *those* three words; my nervousness got the better of me, and I couldn't bring myself to say it out loud. But from [[Eilun]]'s flustered reaction, I think I'd gotten my feelings across just fine. He looked away, embarrassed, and we both sat there for a bit, shy and unsure what to say next. I stared at him longingly, if a bit awkwardly... then pulled him in for a tight embrace. And it didn't take long for him to return it... neither of us spoke, but it felt like a thousand words came out in that moment.

Maybe it was just a coincidence, but it felt like the stars were watching us somehow, because suddenly I noticed lights in the night sky start to shift. Still in each other's arms, we looked up and saw stars begin to streak across the sky... the meteor shower was happening! [[Eilun]] big eyes went wide, and so did mine as we took it in together. I'd never seen anything like it before... it was such a pretty sight, and we kinda just sat there, staring up at the sky in awe.

After a bit, [[Eilun]] suggested we move over to somewhere with a better view of the stars. We found a spot by the edge of the mountain, and continued to admire the stars together for a while. Then [[Eilun]] pulled out a [[Memoria Crystal]] from his bag. I didn't recognize what it was, at first, but he explained to me that it could be used to take pictures and display them as "saved" memories... and that he wanted us to capture this magical moment we shared together. He handed me the crystal and, after teaching me how to use it, I took the picture of us standing together on the mountain top, stars flying by behind us as if giving us their blessing.

...I'm taking a look at the crystal again, right now. [[Eilun]] said I should be the one to keep it with me and, well... I'm getting all sentimental and smiling goofy and even tearing up a bit again, much like how I was after we took that picture together. I was lucky that [[Eilun]] pulled me in for another hug then; it gave me some time to try to hide the happy tears in my eyes. I'm pretty sure he still got to see them, though...

[[Eilun]] pulled out a book from his bag, and showed me some of the pages. He told me about a story he was slowly writing: a story about a little cat named [[Zaku]] and his adventures. He asked if I could read it as he wrote more, and even if I could maybe help him with some of it. Now I'm not much of a reader nor a writer... but how could I say no to him? 

Not long after that, the meteor shower passed. It had gotten pretty late in the night by then, so [[Eilun]] and I (reluctantly) agreed it was time to head back home. We met back up with [[Mirah]] - who I'm sure had been giggling to herself and [[Sockrates]] the whole time - and prepared to make the long walk back.

[[Eilun]] complained about still being tired from the climb going back up, though. So he... asked me if I could carry him back to [[Dawnhearth]]. I didn't even have to think twice about it before I agreed, admittedly because I was really happy to get to hold him in my arms again... he was so warm and soft and cuddly...

##### Mirah:

...Sorry guys, I can take it from here. Bro got all blushy and sentimental and had to step away to cool off for a bit. Not that I blame him, though! [[Eilun]] really *is* super cute, and well... I know it was quite the day for [[Kitah]]. And I'm really happy for the two of them! I know I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed, but I can tell having someone to love like this is something they both needed. [[Kitah]] [[Quiet Admissions|admitted some of his feelings to me as we walked home]], though it's not like I didn't already know... I've got a good feel for these things y'know? (Plus we've got our starlight bond, but shush...)

Being real for a moment though, while he's not here right now... it just makes me so, *so* happy to see [[Kitah]] this way. He's gone through a *lot*, a lot of it likely because of me. Even though we're siblings, there's only so much I can do for him... especially when he always sees me as his younger sister to be protected. But he's finally starting to think more about the things that make *him* happy, and learning to rely on other people for support instead of trying to shoulder everything on his own.

...I say that, but he also carried [[Eilun]] the *entire* way home... [[Kitah]] tried not to show it, but he looked incredibly exhausted by the time we finally arrived at [[Dawnhearth]]. But I could tell he didn't regret it one bit, especially not after seeing the contentment on his face as he fell asleep on the couch with his new kitty partner. I might tease them at times - sorry, boys, it's the [[Mirah]] signature - but I wish nothing for the best for them.
