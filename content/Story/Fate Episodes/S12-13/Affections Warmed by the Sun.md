What a day, dear diary. What a day indeed; one that I’m sure I will never forget as long as I live, yet feel compelled to commit to paper out of sheer sentiment.

It began when [[Astar]] and I had breakfast together, as we have been doing very often recently. Rising early has its benefits, I suppose! I always enjoy spending some time alone together with him; he’s always made me feel so comfortable and, well, wanted.

However, Astar seemed a little stressed out today–not a look I’ve seen on him quite often. I checked in on him, as he was idly playing with his food, and he admitted that he was worried about the supplies we have in the pantry. [[Kitah]] had, reportedly, been eating a lot more than we expected. As a result, our food supplies were running low, and the next shipment wouldn’t be for another few weeks.

I immediately asked if I could help somehow, and we thought about the problem together. Astar suggested we try and establish trade somewhere in [[Everfall]], and perhaps even hunt together for something to sate our appetites in the meantime. I happily accepted; we’d be much more self-sufficient if we could do more of our food trading locally, without having to resort to shipments from other regions.

Our first stop was [[Hazelport]], to the east. I suggested we go straight here, and then take the long way home via the woods Astar had mentioned would be suitable for a hunt. When we checked in with the secretary, however, she was most displeased at Astar’s outfit (or lack thereof, I suppose). He seemed rather hurt by that. I stood up for him, and reassured him that he’s absolutely fine being as shirtless as he wants to be, before asking the insensitive lady where we could find a wholesaler or something in town. She pointed us to the warehouse to the west; [[Hazelport Logistics]].

It took some effort to get any of the workers to give us the time of day; thankfully Astar was able to flag someone down who directed us to Foreman Ben. This Ben, however, was a complete and utter sham. He offered us “six rice” for 300 gold, refusing to elaborate on how much rice that actually is, nor the reason why it costs so much. I’m not sure if he was outrageously incompetent or simply trying to waste our time, but I took Astar and left pretty quickly once it was obvious he wasn’t going to be of any help to us.

Astar and I decided to check around town some more, until we happened across our pal [[Buko]] from [[Dayspring]]. We told him our story, and he was able to offer us a deal with the Fishing Guild–and at a friend’s discount, as we’d been a big help to him in resolving the Jaggi problem. We gladly accepted, breathing a sigh of relief as we had now resolved the long-term problem.

But there’s still the short term to consider! So we set out, glad to still have time to do a little hunting together. Astar showed me a nice spot in a natural bush, where we waited quietly for something to appear. And then, an elk! We marked it as our target, and I decided to try casting Inner Radiance Torrent, a spell I had recently learned but not yet had the chance to try.

Unfortunately, I focused a bit too much of my energy into the spell–perhaps knowing Astar was watching convinced me to give it my all. My “all” was too much. The elk was obliterated by the incandescent beam that blasted forth from my hands, such that all that remained was a pile of ash. All we could do was laugh it off and wait for the next one, really! But I hope I didn’t scare Astar…

The next elk appeared, blissfully unaware of the radiant demise its brethren had met with in that same spot mere moments ago. I decided to take a gentler approach, using my mini-dragons to launch breath attacks at it as Astar kept it occupied at close range with its sword. I used the spell Calm before the elk could retaliate, keeping it docile as we quickly finished it off. I feel like this spell could be very useful; in the future, but equally, the poor elk was probably just too weak to offer much resistance to it.

Astar held the elk’s carcass with just one arm–he always surprises me with his strength! But then, we both sort of raised the suggestion of hunting some more. It didn’t seem entirely necessary, but…we wanted to spend more time together, I suppose, and that was the most convenient excuse. It reminded me of what Astar had said to me back in the church; “any excuse to have you around!”

Before hunting the next one, however, I needed to take a short break to recover my focus; we’d probably be fine without my mini-dragons or Lay On Paws, but I don’t want to take any chances with Astar’s safety on the front line.

We never did begin that second hunt…

Instead, we struck up a conversation as I sat by the nearby river. I restated how happy and comfy I’ve been in the guild, thanks largely to his efforts to make me feel welcomed and safe. And he told me how happy he is to spend time with me alone, just the two of us. It warmed my heart especially because of how picturesque the place was; a quiet forest clearing, with nobody else for miles. It was tranquil, intimate.

We were sitting close together, so he put an arm around me and hugged me tightly against him, running his hand down my arm and, well, making my heart leap from my chest. There was always a special kind of comfort between us, but this sort of affection was enchanting; I wondered for a moment if it was really happening.

I continued by saying that he’s very special to me, and even though I left my home to chase my duty without pressure from others, I’ve learned how special it can be to pursue dreams while helping those special to you do the same. And that he was especially important to me. At that, he licked my cheek! I could barely compose myself, even as he apologised in case the customary show of affection from his homeland was too much.

That was the moment I knew I had to be honest; there was no hiding it anymore. I confessed Astar that, as much as I’m a work-minded person, there have always been moments where I can only think about him instead. And, by the grace of whatever beautiful powers govern the joining of kindred souls, he admitted to the same; I’m always on his mind too. I think that was the moment we both realised our feelings are mutual.

He grabbed me into a much tighter embrace, directly against him, as we both awkwardly expressed how happy we felt in this beautiful moment shared together. My face felt warm with joy and affection, but my body felt warmer by sharing the space with his.

Feelings of love overtook my mind as I shyly, wordlessly asked if we might kiss. So ecstatic was I to be experiencing these feelings for the first time that I dared ask for this, one more special moment to experience for the first time. We bumped muzzles at first, which we both found very funny, before we reconnected with the moment and shared our first kiss in that beautiful place.

And then, our second. Our third, our fourth… Upon his face was a pure smile of bliss and affection, and I’m sure mine was quite the same as we were finally able to speak our feelings in such a beautifully wordless manner. He kept going in for more–and if he didn’t, I feel like I would have…

Some time later (I’m really not sure how long), he invited me to finish my rest by taking a nap on his chest. On the one hand, I felt perfectly rested to complete a second hunt. But on the other, I really loved the idea of resting on him…and he seemed particularly invested in the same. How could I say no? He held me close, letting me use his (exceptionally comfortable) chest as a pillow and petting me slowly and promising to protect me. I don’t believe I’ve ever felt so comfortable. I love him…

I awoke after some time, and he was still there, happily petting through my fur. It was a moment that could have lasted forever and I never would have tired of it. But we still had a job to do–get the elk meat home! He lifted me into his arms, realising shortly afterwards that he needed a free arm to carry the elk. So we settled for holding hands on the way home; something else I was giddy to try with him.

We arrived back at the guild, noticing some of our guildmates asleep on the couch, so we proceeded quietly into the kitchen. [[Rydel]] kindly accepted the mission to go meet Buko and arrange for the fish shipment as Astar asked me about my favourite foods… I made a joke about him being my favourite, before more seriously saying that I love fish–the same as he’d treated me to in [[Risedon]] that one time.

Finally, Astar and I discussed the limited number of bedrooms we’d have when we’re finished constructing the upper floor. He asked if I’d like to share a room with him when that time comes, to save space and so we can spend even more time together. And I answered that there was nothing I would like more.

I love Astar, and he loves me… How it fills me with joy to be able to say that! He vowed to protect me, and I will likewise do everything I can for him.
