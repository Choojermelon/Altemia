*Eating together, Astar looks stressed*

*He says we need more food; Kitah’s been eating us out of house and home*

*We head out to secure more food, and maybe hunt for something to sate us in the meantime*

*First stop: Hazelport, the secretary is rude about Astar being shirtless but she points us to the warehouse on the western side of town*

*I can’t catch their attention so Astar steps in, we’re pointed to Foreman Ben*

*Ben is clearly trying to rip us off, or is incompetent, or both. He offers us “six rice” for 300 gold, which is exorbitant and unspecific*

*We check around town some more and meet with Buko, who says he can hook us up with the fishing guild with a friends’ discount*

*We accept, and head out to hunt something for now*

*We hide in a bush and spy an Elk. I try to hit it with Inner Radiance Torrent, but I put too much power into it and disintegrate it to ashes*

*Astar is astounded, and we wait for the next one*

*I launch an assault of mini-dragons at it, and use Calm to keep it pacified and still, as Astar keeps its attention. I finish it off*

*I say I want to hunt more, but I really just want to spend more time with Astar, who sits by the stream with me as I refocus*

*We talk about our feelings; how happy and comfy I’ve been since we got to the guild, how happy he is to spend time with me, especially alone like this. He hugs me in and strokes my arm, licks my cheek*

*I confess that I’m always thinking about him, and he admits to the same*

*We embrace tightly, get our love out in the open*

*I go for a kiss, he wasn’t expecting it so we bump muzzles, but then I pull him in and we try again*

*We kiss!!! And then again, and again… He seems very happy and keeps going in for more*

*Neither of us are used to this sort of thing, but we’re really happy, and want to keep enjoying our days together like this*

*He has me nap on his chest for a while, protecting me*

*I wake and we head back to the guild, hand in hand (he carries the Elk with his free arm*

*Astar makes me sliced fish from our reserves, and we agree to give Rydel the mission to secure fish from Buko’s guild*

*Astar asks if I want to share a room when we’re all set up (YES!!)*
