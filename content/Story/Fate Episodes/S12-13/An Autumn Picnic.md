We headed back home to take a break after the Well incident in [[Dayspring]] and saw [[Eilun]] and [[Kitah]] resting against the new… skeleton couch, must be recently purchased furniture! I asked [[Eilun]] if he’d like to hang out and he was down to do so! Before we went, [[Eilun]] suggested we make sandwiches and such. [[Kitah]] also asked us if we could make him some sandwiches too before we left to hang out, so we added that to the list.

  

We made some cheese sandwiches, a sandwich just how [[Eilun]] wants it and some green tea stored into a thermos before packing them into a basket. And last but not least, we worked on making the best sandwich [[Kitah]] will ever eat. We had some… technical difficulties with slicing the bread, but it was fine since I transmuted the bread back whole. And… made it grow larger in size the 2nd time around. 

  

[[Mirah]] walked in to check what was going on and it was good timing for them to come by. We asked her to slice the bread instead and it was a big success! She was a lifesaver. Before she left, I gave her the pacifier she asked me to do for her… pet? New worm son? Yes. Which means she doesn’t have to plug [[Sockrates]]’ mouth with her paw. 

  

Afterwards, we continued the [[Kitah]] sandwich and placed the ingredients in a rainbow-colored manner in [[Eilun]]’s suggestion. And we finally finished it! We would bring it to [[Kitah]], but we could barely carry it. So I called [[Kitah]] to come by the kitchen instead. And from the looks of it, his reaction was… what we expected. He was drooling in shock and hunger and immediately went to dig in. Despite its size, it was surprising how long it took for him to finish the sandwich. But we were both happy he was satisfied. And with that, he gave both of us a pet and we went out to the [[Windy Woods]]. 

  

The sight of the entire woods was honestly quite calming. The colors were quite different and much warmer than it was back home. While we walked forward, I found some [[Perfumed Holly]] flowers, great for medicine. And the name says it all with its scent as I plucked out 5 more before we continued on. We reached a good spot for a picnic as we both settled down the mat [[Eilun]] placed down. We had a lovely snacktime and [[Eilun]] asked if I like reading. And because of that, my ears were perked up since reading was basically my life before ending up in [[Altemia]].

  

I tell [[Eilun]] about where I’m from and how I was able to go from my world to theirs via Dream Magic. And speaking of magic, I asked him about Starlight magic, to which he told me about the basics of it and its constellations. And to think he’s able to wield such magic, be it forbidden due to the possibilities it could end up with, that’s by all means, awesome of him to be able to do. Afterwards, we exchanged info about the books we love to read, even giving me a book from [[Rook]].

  

Before I forget, I pull out the flowers I picked out from the entrance and put them together to make a flower crown. Afterwards, I surprised [[Eilun]] by putting it on him and he seems to like it. I was happy that he was happy with it, it makes him look cute~! Not that he wasn’t already, but it was still cute-looking on him!

  

We continued our snack time and introduced me to an amazingly new food I’ve never tried before. I think he called it… “yogurt”? Nevertheless, it was so sweet, the texture was slimy, yet so tasty. And then we ate more sandwiches along with some green tea to drink. 

  

After a few minutes, we finished up our food and drinks until we were full. And it was a nice relaxing time and got to know more about [[Eilun]]. When I thought we were gonna go back to the settlement, he wanted to lay for a bit to take in the autumn breeze. In which I join him for half an hour before going back.

  

Once we reached home, we sat beside each other on the new couch, relaxing after hours of walking. [[Kitah]] welcomes us back home and puts the basket back to where we grabbed it from. As he comes back, he notices the flower crown on [[Eilun]]’s head, to which in surprise, he also pulls out a flower crown. The two make quite the cute pair, wearing flower crowns together. I offered [[Kitah]] to sit beside [[Eilun]], but instead, [[Eilun]] wanted to sit on [[Kitah]]’s lap which caused [[Kitah]] to be as red as a tomato. But he didn’t say no.

  

[[Mori]] grabbed us some blankets to tuck us in as well as for [[Eilun]] and [[Kitah]]. [[Kitah]] wraps both of them in a blanket while [[Mori]] sits by me to rest. Today was such a nice day. I’m glad I got to hang with [[Eilun]].
