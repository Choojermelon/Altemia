<p class="akira">Written by Akira</p>

I had made sure that the [[The Skybound Wanderers|guild]]’s goods were secure in [[Ekron]], thankfully no looters or thieves or similar trying to get away with anything. [[Furiko]] certainly wouldn’t be happy if things got stolen, and neither would I. Having made sure that all was in order, I took a stroll around the port town to take in the fresh air and just move my legs in general; standing guard all the time is a little boring and makes my body yearn for movement. As I reached the eastern marketplace and gate, I chanced to run into [[Mori]] and [[Bertea]] of the guild, an unexpected encounter.

It seemed like they had come to Ekron to just take in the sights, and with this place here I can’t fault them for it - it’s quite beautiful and I haven’t really taken it all in yet myself. I took them away from the bustling places to a nice spot where we could look over the port proper, and engaged in a bit of chatter. They were curious about my rifle and origins, so I told them a little about [[Pholens]] and how I made the rifle myself as a labour of love. Simultaneously I was curious about Mori’s gun as he had told me it was from his home, which apparently was way further away than the [[Smoking Isles]].

As I took his gun for a closer inspection, he dropped something on me though: the gun and he infused the bullets with magic. My heart nearly skipped a beat and I almost dropped his pistol out of shock, quickly handing it back to him. Magic! In a gun! Now I’ve truly heard it all! As if magic wasn’t already dangerous enough, now they put it in a precise weapon to kill from a distance! At that point I was stressed and close to panicking, but before either of them could press the issue (I may have told Bertea off rather harshly) I went on with the sightseeing instead.

I showed them around a little more with what I knew of at least, that being the central bridge and the western gate. We had some tense conversation until Bertea announced he wanted to take a closer look at the merchants again to see what they had; I took this moment to ask Mori to stay behind. As much as I hated it, I needed to learn more about this magic. Any magic I can learn of is valuable enough to understand the foes I may face back on the Isles. Dream Magic, apparently. He can kind of manifest it with his bullets and gun and shoot enemies with it. Terrifying.

Must have noticed my…condition. I guess I’m doing a bad job at hiding it, he asked what had happened and if I had lost anyone to it. I assured him it didn’t affect my hometown, but…I can’t bring myself to talk about [[Sheliff]]. It hurts. Just thinking about [[Echo of the Past|it]], my fellow guards, the poor citizens…all gone and…ugh…why couldn’t I stop it…why was I the sole guard to make it out…why didn’t I save my captain as he protected us…the pain…my fur…forever carrying this mark with me…

Right, Mori…I didn’t tell him things outright. I couldn’t. I just alluded to one thing or another. That magic is dangerous. He seemed to understand. I begged him to use his…”gift” responsibly. For the right cause. He assured me he would, but he’ll have to prove it to me rather than promise. The only reason I have a bit of trust in him is because he’s with the guild and Furiko seems to trust the guy, and I suppose Rook as well.

Then he noticed Bertea. Bugger had been eavesdropping and scooted away from a corner, and I stood behind him before he could even realise I was there. I may have been pretty aggressive and he apologised quickly, but I stormed off to the bridge to clear my head a little. The two of them followed me eventually and Bertea gave me a more earnest apology, which I accepted eventually. Also urging him to use his magic with caution, if at all. Also gave me the same promise, but as I said…actions speak louder than words. 

I noticed it getting late, so I suggested they move back to Risedon before there were no more carriages going. We split ways there, and I went back to check on the goods…a while longer until we would [[A Whole New World|set sail]]…

<p class="akira">Another story</p>

Surprises often come in packs, don’t they? I was strolling around Ekron when I ran across [[Kitah]], [[Mirah]], [[Rook]], Bertea and [[Xayamynx|Xaya]]. Looks like they had a craving for the local food specialties, especially Kitah (that guy seems to have a grand appetite), and this resulted in them getting some kraken stuff. We had some idle chatter, though Mirah’s presence made me…uncomfortable, like, she seems very spectral and not normal at all.

My discomfort must have been notable as we kept chatting and eventually she just…approached and…pet me. This was…not okay. She…felt like she was there, and not there. I was freaking out. Panicking. I brushed her off and threw a fit before storming off to the pier, hoping to calm down somehow. Kitah must’ve been concerned as he followed me and stopped by to check in on me, it’s kind of him.

Seeing as their names are similar and they look similar, I eventually asked him what the deal with Mirah was. So for one, she is his sister. For another, she is a phantom. I couldn't really wrap my head around it. Apparently, she had died a while ago and then suddenly reappeared by his side a while after in her current form. As it seems, that’s the result of starlight magic…yet another type I must be aware of it seems.

My…experience with magic aside, I felt truly sorry for him (and how I reacted) - nobody should lose their sibling or family. Seems like his desire to be with her manifested through the magic and he doesn’t really have a solid grasp on it yet, learning it…and it seems like her death weighs on him. As we talked, I must’ve made it apparent enough that I’ve experienced my own stuff, in particular when combined with magic. I insisted it could be dangerous. He countered that my weapon was much the same.

Maybe he has a point. Yet I still see differences, I think. He wanted to know more, but I stayed vague. I barely know him yet, but it seems we’ve both experienced things that haunt us. Maybe…I can open up to him more in the future. Maybe. Though…I would have to open up to it myself first. The tragedy…I don’t want to confront it. Kitah seemed to catch on to this being a big thing for me and he let it be, and I just asked him to be careful with how he uses his magic should he learn more of it.

At the end, I bid him call Mirah over so I could apologise to her. Little did I expect for her to literally just pop into existence right next to him after he had closed his eyes for a little. Spooked me half to death and almost into the water, this was going to be something I wouldn’t get used to for a while. However, I apologised (while very frazzled) and asked Kitah to explain things further later.

We returned to the others and together delighted in those sweet apples and some kraken meat, just passing the time for the remaining day. At some point we got to the topic of procuring ammunition so I showed off my skill to make temporary ammo out of the alchemical reagents around me. Bertea and Xaya in particular seemed interested, with the former offering to exchange recipes sometime and the latter being in awe in general.

Oh and we kind of explained to Xaya how my gun was a bit like a big and dangerous bow. Maybe sometime when she’s learned more of our civilization I can tell her more precisely what my trusty gun is and how it works. After a long time, the others decided to return to Risedon and leave me to my duties over here. I bid them farewell for the time being, and now I’m thinking…maybe the people here could use a handy crafter like me in the port. Wouldn’t hurt to check and make a bit of money on the side…
