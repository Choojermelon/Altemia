This had already been a day, you know? The arrival of [[Xayamynx|Xaya]], the ensuing damage (that I had to repair which took me a while and left me some bruises from the hammer), it all made for quite the spectacle. And I thought that nothing could top this, I mean, it would take something extraordinary and special to be able to make this day even moreâ€¦special. Or rather, someone. Just as I got done with fixing the floor (good as new, [[Furiko]] was pretty happy), I heard [[Kasparr]]'s voice calling out to me.

I wasnâ€™t exactly happy to see him again, but he brought along someone who I assumed to be his druid friend. He introduced me to [[Kloros]], a (apparently sleepy?) druid who basically laid out to me that taking the [[Freddy|bear]] back to the mountains wouldnâ€™t be feasible thanks to the [[Red Moon Cult]] wreaking havoc over there. He did however have a plan which he wanted to discuss with Furiko.

So, apparently the [[The Skybound Wanderers|guild]] is launching an expedition in a couple of weeks to build up a new [[Dawnhearth|settlement]] in the [[The Outer Rim|Outer Rim]]. Kloros wanted to cash in a favor with Furiko and come with us, and the bear could be taken care of on the ship and over in the Outer Rim, maybe even released. Our guild master then asked me to accompany the guild on the second of our ships so that I could continue to take care of it and maybe even give it a name (should I name it after him?) while also serving as a sentry and help in other ways. I mean, sure, why not? Anything to go out and hone my skills is good, and I guess itâ€™ll be nice to maybe have the bear end up happy and grown up, maybe even docile.

And then I had it dropped on me that Kasparr would be joining us as well and has been referred to as my second pet. What? Ughh I really didnâ€™t need him along, but I guess thereâ€™s no changing that now. Oh and I was told by Furiko that I am to escort a carriage full of the guildâ€™s goods to [[Ekron]] where weâ€™d depart, in less than two hours. Kasparr was supposed to tell me two weeks ago! Gahhh I have no time for this, Gods help me, I need to make my preparations and head out to Ekron like now!
