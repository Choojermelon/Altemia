The day seemed particularly free of responsibility, so I decided the time had come to seal the Chalice. Kitah and Mirah were more than willing to help, as well as Astar, who I was particularly interested in inviting due to his control over water; this journey would involve a bit of sea travel, after all! Eilun also expressed interest in coming along, but confided that he wouldn’t be able to due to his special circumstances forbidding him from leaving Risedon. However, we weren’t going to give up! We spoke to Furiko, who kindly granted him leave to journey with us as long as we took full responsibility for his actions and ensured he didn’t cast cosmic magic. Astar’s presence was likely a factor in his kind decision as well.

  

We caught a carriage to the port town of Ekron, and got to see Eilun’s face light up as he experienced sights beyond the city walls! I don’t say this lightly: It was precious beyond words. I felt like we had done a good thing, allowing him to see a bit more of the world. Once we arrived, this continued, as we all became tourists for a brief early afternoon. The five of us (except Mirah, I suppose…) ate kraken together, checked out the docks, and rented an affordable boat--thanks to the Quietus leaving a few ships unused at the harbour.

  

Astar kindly took control of the helm, revealing his experience with this sort of thing, and it was literal smooth sailing until we reached our destination. A small cave formation in the waters of the neighbouring region, placed on the side of a very ordinary-looking mountain, was where we landed. The others were understandably concerned as the darkness stretched on for half an hour of walking, but my signet showed me the way, and they placed their trust in me as I guided them through.

  

We emerged at the hidden Uvuko Cathedral of Neralmia. It was quite a sight to behold for my guardians, and also for myself. I see they spared no expense on making the place look as good as it does. But, with work to do, we proceeded further inside and were greeted by a colleague of mine; a young rabbit knight of the church. He guided us to the secret passage held within a burial chamber. And as my signet opened the way, we proceeded down the long, long passage, staircases and corridors and all.

  

Finally, we emerged at the Sanctum, where I performed the ritual to seal the Chalice of Blight for good. It was nice having my friends bear witness to this, and get a glimpse of the work I do as a cleric. Business as usual for me, but an exotic experience for the others--especially Eilun! Not wanting to linger, we returned to the church proper and made light conversation over tea. I may have let a grunt of frustration escape me as I was reminded of the church’s sometimes-less-than-honourable methods of spreading the good word, but I was nonetheless grateful to spend the day somewhere that reminds me of home.

*Kitah and Eilun chat for a while, and spar to test Eilun’s magic!*

*Rook watches, before talking to Astar about both their pasts. Then, exhausted, he sleeps on Astar’s lap…*

When I went back to Astar, he woke up and was happy to see me. He and I talked for a while about our respective homelands, and he said he’s really happy to still have me around. Honestly, it was nice to spend a moment alone together after a busy day with someone I lov treasure. After some talking, however, I began to feel the weight of the day’s pressures upon me, stretching out on the grass and enjoying the quiet, broken only by distant choirs. That’s when he invited me to sleep on his lap, and I felt my heart leave my chest for a moment. But how would I ever refuse? Especially with how happy he seemed about it. Oh, goodness…

*The others return, and Rook wakes to make dinner for the group*

*They turn in for the night, and decide to head home early in the morning*

Once we got outside the church, I remembered during my nap, I had dreamed of small, aspect-like dragons. They took the form of each of the Crystal Dragons (not just Uvuko), and I still felt their presence within my soul. I called this presence to the front of my mind, focusing on it hard, and discovered that I was able to summon them into reality, just for a few instants. Their breath is potent, and each has a different element… I think this may be useful in the trials to come.

*On the way back, in Ekron, they pick up krakandy apples, including one for Furiko*

*Upon their return, Furiko suggests that getting permission for Eilun to leave more will be tricky. He suggests the gang write letters to the Spire petitioning for his freedom.*
