The story begins in Oakenpost, where they meet Reinald.

<p class="rook">We are a small squad dispatched by the Skybound Wanderers to investigate a request about a missing heirloom lying somewhere within the dead town of Alryne. I (Rook) will be overseeing this mission under the jurisdiction of Guildmaster Furiko. As a recent transfer to the guild with some experience in finding items, he believes me to be a good fit. Not just for this request, but also to watch over several new members taking their training exam in the form of this very same quest. They are Kitah, a red lizardfolk wearing elaborate garb;  Yoram, a large scaled man who seems to have some tricks up his sleeve; and Mori, whose species I cannot ascertain but he is small and quiet and has a gun… Oh, and Kitah’s sister Mirah, in the form of a ghost being summoned by him? Not something I’ve seen the likes of before, but she seems friendly. No complaints here!</p>  

<p class="kitah">We arrived in the small mountain town of Oakenpost and met up with our client, Reinald, who also happened to be the bartender for the local tavern. We conversed with him and discussed the details of our quest over a meal. Gotta say, the cooked badger they serve is quite tasty… and we were fortunate enough to have an extra taste of it after we dealt with a pack of wild badgers who unexpectedly attacked a lady in the town. Not to say that it was fortunate for the poor lady, but… silver linings, you know?</p>

  

<p class="mori">We began our search for Reinald’s special item in a dark dim forest. There, we encountered those damn cultists. Once they spotted us, they tried to attack us, but we gained the upper hand. And upon inspecting them, I was right. I knew it was them and it looks like I’m on the right track. I didn’t share my knowledge with them about these cultists. Yet. That aside, we ventured forward and cautiously. Since we now know that we are not alone in these forests.</p>

  

<p class="rook">Continuing our search, we advanced into Alryne proper–a collection of derelict, abandoned buildings beyond the forest, exactly as described. There, I performed a quick autopsy on someone who had long since died, with Reinald’s permission. I discovered that Ghoul Fever was the cause of death. Perhaps this was what annihilated the town in its entirety.</p>

  

<p class="rook">Still in search of Reinald’s heirloom, we happened upon an old, shut-down tavern. It took some bravery to go inside, what with strange cultists and their arisen henchmen littering the forest, but we pressed on. Inside, we discovered a small dragon tied up named Fyr, who we promptly rescued. He tells us that he works for the library in the city of Risedon, the same city where we signed up with the Guild and accepted this mission. As a talented young lad with some skills in magic, we felt capable of escorting him through the forest and eventually back home.</p>

  

<p class="rook">Fyr soon proved himself to be more than capable, enchanting Mori’s gun to easily dispatch another group of cultists we encountered further into the forest. I’m glad everything is proceeding so smoothly; my healing magic is useful, but it’s even better when not needed at all.</p>
