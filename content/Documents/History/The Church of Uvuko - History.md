## Introduction

_“O, Uvuko, boundary between earth and sky…” - From a common Odrarian prayer_  
  

Legend tells that Uvuko blesses the land through his whimsical skybound travels, bestowing bountiful harvests upon those who inhabit his territories. So too do his followers charge themselves with effecting positive change in the world, and vow to prevent the march of progress from stagnating. They are staunch believers in advancement, growth, and safety.

Those who devote themselves to Uvuko often receive myriad blessings, causing a cleric of Uvuko to stand out somewhat from the crowd. The athleticism to overcome obstacles, the sanction to deliver justice with an iron maul, and the ability to bestow an ally with speed are some of these blessings.

Furthermore, just as Uvuko loves his children from afar, equally the Church enacts a great clandestine operation to protect the world’s population from dangerous magical artifacts–to wit, artifacts which would put a great number of people in jeopardy if they were to fall into the wrong hands. This is the sacred duty of the church’s Grail Knights, a subsidiary organisation known only to a select few and their most trusted allies.  
  

## The High Seat

The Church of Uvuko’s largest cathedral is located in Odraria where Uvuko is most commonly worshipped. It stands loudly and proudly at the centre of the holy city Terra Draconis, boasting one of the largest populations of any religious site in the world due to this unique circumstance. Its height and significance among Uvuko’s followers has earned it the moniker “The High Seat”.

The city is a somewhat popular destination for foreign students and tourists because of its historic and religious significance. On the other hand, its permanent population contains a great proportion of clergymen and pilgrims. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of residents are followers of Uvuko–even those who work outside of the church.

Terra Draconis is also home to one of the largest quantities of orphanages out of all Altemian cities, owned and funded by the church as part of its charity work. Children there are treated as equals, regardless of their background. Odrarian law attempts to prevent religious indoctrination by ensuring that the education there is well-rounded and includes the teachings of several of the Crystalline Dragons, but understandably many clergymen of Uvuko can trace their background to this orphanage as they naturally fell in with the religion that surrounded them in their daily life.

The orphanages have Germanic-based names, such as “Richter House”, “Abend House”, and “Erde House”. They were built after the war between (the nearby dog and cat nations) caused the city to see an influx of refugees, many young and without parents.  
  

## Other Religious Sites

_“The Earth Dragon’s love reaches far and wide!” - Line from a popular Odrarian carol_

Churches and religious institutes of Uvuko are commonplace in Odraria, but also somewhat scattered throughout Altemia in general. Missionaries and travelling priests have seen varying degrees of success in delivering the teachings of Uvuko to other regions; most notably, Neralmia and Lirnia have historically had little to do with the Earth Dragon. As such, these two regions are each home to only one Church of Uvuko, and these are hidden away in secret.

Indeed, not every church devoted to Uvuko operates out in the open. Due to the covert nature of the Grail Knights’ mission, and fears within the inner circles of the church regarding spreading teachings too wildly, some of these lay hidden in secret locations on a need-to-know basis. Only a Grail Knight or one of the highest-ranking members of the church could tell you the location of every single one.

The church located in Neralmia can only be reached by sea travel. It is cloaked using a mysterious enchantment that keeps the church invisible to anyone until they get close enough, and this travel involves a careful boat ride into the hollow of an otherwise nondescript mountain.

## The Grail Knights

_“No religious organisation is without its secrets.” - Solomon’s Worldly Wisdom, Ch.3_

The Church’s sacred mission to protect the people from dangerous artifacts could not meet with any success by sending only religious men of cloth into dangerous territory to retrieve them. As such, the Church of Uvuko created the Grail Knights, a clandestine sub-group that belongs to the Church whilst also standing on equal footing.

A regular clergyman’s duty would involve delivering religious services, running the church, and taking care of the orphanage. In contrast, a Grail Knight is responsible for investigating (and oftentimes retrieving) dangerous artifacts. These clerics are trained in combat from the moment they join, taking full advantage of Uvuko’s blessing bolstering their athletic prowess. After all, the signature weapon of the Uvuko is the Maul, able to strike the earth with force and purpose–and not easily lifted without some measure of strength.

Every Grail Knight is presented with a Grail Signet to mark their fealty and affiliation. Channelling holy energy through the signet allows the usage of Grail’s Favour, a mighty blessing that helps both the Cleric and their allies strike true. One who trusts Grail Knights may be assured that they are in good company by seeing this signet. To all others, it appears to be a strange coin and little else.

There is some concept of rank among the Grail Knights, but the details are unknown at this time.

## The Sacred Sanctum

_“Reveal to me the path that leads to your sacrament!” - From the Opening Ritual_

Below each major church of Uvuko (usually the largest one in a given region) is a secret, sacred ground to which access is strictly prohibited for the majority of people. Only a Grail Knight may enter, albeit accompanied by their most trusted guardians if they so wish.

This begins with a long walk down a corridor to a dead end. The Knight must stand in the middle of the path, present their Signet, and speak the Opening Ritual. A mysterious high-level enchantment will then open the way through the wall, but only if everyone present holds true in their heart a promise not to reveal this place’s existence to anyone but those in whom they have full, uncompromising trust. Any less than this, and the way will not open.

Beyond this dead end is a long spiral staircase, leading to the Sacred Sanctum, a mysterious chamber deep underground–hosted here to be connected deeply to Uvuko’s element. The chamber is large, quiet, and holds a liminal sort of beauty beyond its function. The exact design varies between each region’s church, but there is often still water and a sense of connection to the elements.

This hard-to-reach room is host to a great number of active, powerful enchantments which prevent magical items from functioning–made possible only due to the deep connection with the Earth Dragon from so deep underground. Be careful, as even the magic items in one’s inventory will temporarily cease to function! But most crucially, this makes a Sacred Sanctum the perfect place for sealing away dangerous artifacts, that they might never again jeopardise the lives of innocent Altemians.
