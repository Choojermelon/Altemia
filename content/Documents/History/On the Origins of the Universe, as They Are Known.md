At the beginning of the universe, Rylbar, the Astral dragon, created a tapestry full of stars as a gift for their sibling, Altemia.

Overjoyed by this pristine gift, Altemia would sprinkle the heavens with the primordial elements and, as such, countless planets of all shapes and sizes were created. After thousands of years, Altemia realised that one such planet grew life within it, and decided to nurture it, protecting it from any dangers that would rise. To Altemia, such lives were incredibly fragile, and there was a sense of wonder and excitement in taking care of them and helping them prosper without directly interfering with their lives.

One day, one of the ancient civilizations would, by serendipity, find the gift of magic, and with it they would enact rituals in which theyâ€™d praise the gods they believed in. Amused by this, Altemia created a reflection of her own image in front of them and taught them how to use advanced incantations. To Altemia, such spells were nothing but childsplay, but this would push civilizations forward by leaps and bounds. Impressed by such an apparition, they decided to name the planet after her. After that she would appear in times of struggle and famine to help those in need, while also teaching them more of her magic. Crystals were the common catalyst with which anyone could cast magic with some practice, as they inherently possessed some of the elements found in nature.

At one point, she witnessed how the civilizations she helped prosper used the same magic to fight each other. After a devastating globe-spanning war that almost destroyed the entire world, called The War of the Shattered Skies, she swore to never get herself involved directly in mankind's affairs.

Instead, Altemia and Rylbar would create the Elder Dragons, who would serve as the protectors of this planet, only intervening when the threat would cause the destruction of the planet itself and not only its civilizations. After this, Rylbar and Altemia left, never to be seen again.
