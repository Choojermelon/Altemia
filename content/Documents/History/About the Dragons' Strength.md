# Young Dragons
These dragons are considered young if they haven’t lived more than a thousand years. They’re usually medium or small-sized and are associated with an element or concept at birth by the tribe or society that takes care of them. They are tasked with finding a job with the main purpose of bettering the world, and to gather knowledge of the lands of [[Altemia]] one way or another.
# Dragons 
These dragons can range from 1000 to 5000 years old, and tend to be large-sized. They serve as sages and counselors for the lands they live in, and are also tasked with taking care of the offspring that have been born. They’re pacifist and avoid being involved in any conflicts in an aggressive manner, and will try to find the middle point between both parties.

They have mastered the element or concept they were born with, commanding it at ease and easily overpowering any group of foes if they so needed.
# Elder Dragons
With a much older age than any of the dragons, these have seen civilizations rise and fall countless times. Just like the original Elder Dragons, they’ve decided not to intervene with mortal affairs unless the planet itself needs to. They’re as huge as mountains and cities and could easily create a world-wide calamity if they used their full power.
Once an Elder Dragon passes away due to age or other causes, a new dragon among the wisest ones is appointed as its replacement. This is always a historical event as most dragons are involved with society in one way or another.

# Primordial Dragons
Dragons that could cause universal cataclysms due to their strength magnitudes above anyone else. They lead the dragons related to their respective attunements or elements. They rarely, if ever, are seen by civilizations and even other dragons, and such sights always mark the change of an era. Their planetary proportions are inconceivable to mortals, so whenever they appear in front of them, they use a smaller-sized reflection of themselves.
