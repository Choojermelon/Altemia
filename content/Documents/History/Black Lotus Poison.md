A mysterious alchemical agent employed by the [[Brighthammer Thieves Guild]] in [[Everfall]].

There is little information on its ingredients or origin, but it is known to create a potent aetherical disconnection between body and soul. As a result, the victim is left paralysed for up to a week.

Although the effects are nonlethal, succumbing to its effects would leave one unable to fight, as even a mighty soldier would have trouble walking or completing basic tasks.

It is exceedingly volatile, so must be administered on the day it is made, but its effect cannot be treated via conventional means.
