I do enjoy quiet days like this - well, figuratively quiet. The town’s bustling with activity as always, with merchants looking to sell and buy, workers earning their daily coin…a welcome and peaceful sight. Sure, you’ll always have some odd ones out who have to be put in place, but that’s what we guards of Sheliff do, no?

Feels good to keep the peace and know that everyone is pretty safe, we work vigilantly to make sure that law and order are upheld and the population protected from harm. External threats such as bandits and wild animals, and internal problems like thieves and dishonest merchants - no matter what, we’d deal with the problems. I’m quite happy to be a part of this, even if me misjudging things led to a problem or two before. Live and learn, you know?

Gazing across the marketplace, I close my eyes and take a deep breath…but when I open them again, I freeze in shock. Gone is the bustling town center, vanished have the happy people - all I see is fire and smoke, engulfing the town’s buildings. Bodies scattered across the ground, many disfigured, charred, some even frozen; limbs blown away from the torso, torn clothes, sounds of agony - I found myself in what could only be described as hell on this planet.

I cannot move except for my head and eyes, processing yet failing to understand what the hell is happening. How this happened. What is going on? Where are my fellow guards, didn’t we fend off whatever happened? Looking around…there are also people in uniform among the bodies, lifeless like all the rest. All ranks present, from the regular patrol to the high captains and commanders…was anyone even left alive?

My eyes fixate the smoke in front of me all of a sudden, movement barely visible through it. Out of it stumbles my own captain, who made me a guard in this town a while ago. Trembling and with a look of panic he extends a hand out to me, only for a bright orange light behind him to engulf his body as flames take over the position he stood in, screams of pain and suffering as he is burnt alive before falling dead to the ground, charred beyond recognition.

A bunch of hooded figures step through the smoke, some of them holding tomes, wands and other things. Laughing triumphantly, a great number of them come into view, their faces impossible to see. “So much for the guards of Sheliff, you brought far less of a fight than we anticipated. You utterly failed to protect this town, and all you could do was stand at the side and back, unable to make any difference. You are useless, cat.”

The words ring through my head. Again and again. Had I been forgetting to breathe? Had I been holding my breath? I suddenly gasp as I think of it, the stench of smoke filling my lungs, I clutch my chest and slump to the ground, panting, closing my eyes that have filled with tears…only to open them to darkness, still panting, but without smoke filling my lungs.

I am in my makeshift bed here in Dawnhearth, it is night time and everyone else is asleep. It’s pleasantly cool in the room, though that is more of a problem due to me being fully drenched in sweat. I slowly get my breathing under control again, wiping the tears from my eyes. Stupid nightmare…even though the events didn’t actually play out as they did in it, they were based on real ones. I was there. I get up and brush a paw through my sweat-stained fur. I guess I’ll have to take a night time bath and hopefully not wake anyone. If I didn’t draw attention with my nightmare already. It begs the question: will I ever be able to come face to face with it?
