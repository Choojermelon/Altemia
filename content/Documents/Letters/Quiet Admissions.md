“You’re still thinking about earlier today, aren’t you?”

It had been a few hours since they’d left the mountain top and started journeying back to Dawnhearth, yet the feelings in [[Kitah]]’s head and heart hadn’t calmed down one bit. His mind kept thinking about the time he spent with [[Eilun]] - the shy yet tender embrace they shared as they sat, their unspoken but undeniable admission of love for each other, the dazzling sight of shooting stars streaking the night sky, the moment captured forever within the memoria crystal now in his pack--

“A-ah!” [[Kitah]]’s thoughts were interrupted by a poke to his side, earning a yelp from the dragon. 

“Oi! Earth to [[Kitah]], are you there? You good?” [[Mirah]]’s loud voice cut through the quiet night air, over the rustling of leaves beneath their feet. Fortunately [[Eilun]], who had been sleeping peacefully in [[Kitah]]’s arms, wasn’t awoken by this. The lizardfolk felt him stir slightly, though, and shot [[Mirah]] a glare.

“Sorry…” she said, lowering her voice a little. “But you’ve been awfully quiet this whole time we’ve been walking… I mean, uncharacteristically so, even for you!”

“Yeah, but isn’t it even weirder that *you* haven’t been chatting my ear off?”

[[Mirah]] put her hands on her hips. “That’s because I figured you needed the space to think, dummy…”

“Well…” [[Kitah]] sighed. “It’s just… I don’t think I’ve felt this way with anyone before. Like… I could let my guard down around him, and just being around him makes me feel like… happy, and better about myself… I just wanna hold and protect him like, well, what I’m doing now, and…” He turned away from [[Mirah]], looking down at the cat in his arms, before continuing sheepishy, “He’s really, really cute…”

[[Mirah]] chuckled. “You love him, don’t you?” she said, with no hint of teasing in her voice.

[[Kitah]] blushed so brightly, even his red fur couldn’t hide it. “I… I do, I really do… And considering today, I think he feels the same, though I guess both of us were too shy to say it outright…”

“Hah! I know, I just wanted to hear you say it,” she said, a grin on her face. ”And of course he does too, silly! Neither of you have been very subtle about it, heheh…”

Something about admitting it out loud loosened [[Kitah]] up, and he couldn’t help but laugh too. “Can’t deny that, ahah… And it’s just nice to have someone who just cares for me, not because I’m handsome or because I’m useful, or whatever… He doesn’t make me feel like I need to give anything to earn his affection, and because of that I want to give him everything…”

[[Mirah]] gave her brother a warm smile. She rarely got to see her brother like this. He was always looking out for others first, and didn’t often think of what he himself wanted… Well, outside of food, at least. 

“I’m really happy for ya bro, you know that? You two are gonna be a lovely couple, I can see it already! And, since I know you’re gonna be thinking it… don’t worry about giving him more attention and me being jealous or whatever. Love him however you want to, and don’t fret over lil’ old me.”

It was embarrassing how well his sister knew him, sometimes. “Are… are you sure?”

“Silly… I’ve had to be your younger sister for nineteen years! It’s about time you doted on someone else instead…” [[Mirah]] was joking, obviously. “But really… you’ve always been looking out for me, so it’s nice to see you wanting something for yourself, for once. It’d make me happy if you two could just enjoy each other without worrying about me.”

The thought made [[Kitah]] feel guilty, and he wanted to protest. But he couldn’t ignore how his heart felt, nor deny that [[Mirah]]’s words were exactly the kind of reassurance he quietly wanted. 

“... Thanks, [[Mirah]].”

They didn’t say anything more after that, and continued the walk home in silence… for a few moments, at least, before [[Mirah]] piped up again.

“You should kiss him!”

“W-what?? He’s asleep!”

“I didn’t mean a passionate tongue kiss, dummy! Just a little smooch on the cheek or something! I know you’ve been wanting to do it…”

He looked down at [[Eilun]]’s sleeping face, which now had a bit of drool trickling down his cheek. *He really looks cute when he’s asleep…* [[Kitah]] thought to himself. After a moment’s hesitation - and a reassuring thumbs-up from [[Mirah]] - he leaned over and tenderly kissed the cat on his cheek. “I love you, [[Eilun]],” he whispered.

[[Eilun]] didn’t wake up, but a content smile appeared on his face, and he purred. This, of course, made [[Kitah]]’s heart melt.

“Miraaaaah,” he sobbed, “he’s so *cute…*”
