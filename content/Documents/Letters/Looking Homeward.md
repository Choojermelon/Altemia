My dear parents,

I hope this letter finds you well, once more. A few things have happened since I last wrote, I only felt it right and necessary to tell you about them. This would hopefully also do to ease any worries you might have regarding me.

It would seem I am one of the only people in this guild who does not have any hint of magic in them whatsoever, if there were any I am yet to encounter them. While my skills and fighting prowess aren’t lacking compared to them, it does make me feel a bit like an outsider - then again, I do come from far away for Risedon standards. What is certain is that I miss being surrounded by technology and the like in Pholens, it’s a lot more homely than the arcane and whatever else I’ve learned exists in the realm of magic.

Nevertheless, some people here seem to be rather fine, so while I feel like an outsider I at least am not fully alone. Especially now, with…well, I shall recount this tale briefly. A huge bear had been causing trouble outside the city perimeters and I alongside a few others were asked to deal with the problem. I played the largest part in slaying the animal after another person (who is very full of himself, may I add) managed to track it down with us, but we discovered only after bringing it low that it had a cub.

So yeah, now I am feeling guilty about this cub having nowhere to go and no parent, so I took it under my care and named it Freddy after a while. At the very least I will care for it until it can be returned to the wilderness at some point or another solution comes up. I’ve taken it with me now - we set forth from the port town of and travelled to distant lands in the Outer Rim where we are establishing a settlement for our guild. I was asked to come along for guard duty (the past is still with me, I see) and I also put the engineering knowledge to use I gained thanks to you.

I…well, I didn’t talk to them about it specifically. But two people in particular, I at least alluded to the topic of…you know. That I am not fond of magic for certain reasons. At least one of them has some sort of past of their own which seems to weigh on him, while I am sorry for him it is also nice to have a sense of kinship somewhere. Maybe it’ll lead to something greater. His sister is a phantom of sorts because she died and her brother more or less willed her spirit back to his side.

It frightens me but at the same time…it’s not like I can’t understand such a desire. Would that I could will their lives back into existence. But it is not to be.

Keep watch over yourselves, will you? I hope to come by Pholens again sometime, I do miss the city. Ideally, however, I will become strong enough to face them. Maybe, if I’m lucky, I can even bring the guild along. The more I see, the more I feel like I will require all the help I can get - especially with how weak I feel whenever the event comes back to my mind…

Your loving daughter
