*A letter penned by [[Rook]] to convince the authorities in [[Risedon]] to give [[Eilun]] freedom, that he might journey to [[Everfall]] and beyond with [[The Skybound Wanderers]].*

To whom it may concern,

I write to you petitioning the freedom of a young savant of Risedon.

I speak of Sir Eilun. He is currently stationed as a trainee at the Skybound Wanderers guild, yet by legal edict is not permitted to leave the boundaries of our fair city. This is an understandable restriction that you and yours have set, given his possession of cosmic magic. We at the guild fully understand the concerns at hand, and have ensured that this restriction is followed.

However, after bringing Eilun on a journey to a neighbouring region (under the sanction of Guildmaster Furiko and the supervision of Waveguard Astar), and seeing how he handled himself, I am confident that he has both the aptitude and the sense of responsibility to see the walls beyond our city. He presents no danger, this I assure you.

The Guild would be most grateful to benefit from his abilities as we begin our large-scale expedition to The Outer Rim, and Eilun himself would gain much from the experience. This would be an excellent opportunity for him to practice the safer, sanctioned forms of magic he has been studying every day.

Aside from the untapped potential you would unleash by allowing Eilun to come with us, I wish to openly appeal to the moral obligation we all have to simply allow a kind young man to see the world. I witnessed how this shy, soft-spoken young man was able to come out of his shell and light up the room with his smile when presented with interesting new sights and sounds outside of the city.

Allow me to leave you with a quote from one of the sacred texts I hold dear, which I find to be pertinent to this situation.
"That brief expression of open-mindedness was all it took to effect change. The ripples it made upon the future frolicked through the fields, ran through the hills, and spread their bounty to even the skies above."
These symbolic words convey to us the boons inherently wrought by a well-placed change of heart. So do I urge you, our esteemed members of the Spire, to grant Eilun this freedom. For the benefit of the guild, of Neralmia, and of one individual whose future I firmly believe to be incandescently brightâ€”if by your grace he may be uncaged.

My profuse gratitude for taking the time in your busy schedule(s) to read this.

Regards,
Rook Margrace
