Dear Mom, dear Dad,

first of all, this letter finding you means I’m indeed hale and whole. Or, at the very least I was when I sent it, I am very far away from you after all…

So, I actually managed to find my way there, just like you said I would! Risedon, located in Neralmia, what a city it is…I guess you two knew I wouldn’t be fond of it. With like, the entire city being focused on magic and all, yet here I am. I’m seeing this as a means to an end for now, given how you and everyone I met recommended the Skybound Wanderers to me as the Adventurer’s Guild.

Speaking of the guild, I managed twofold already: I made a handful of acquaintances and, following an unplanned liberation of a sawmill from bandits, was allowed to undertake a full mission to prove my worth and become an Initiate! Seems my accurate shots impressed them, though the whole thing was not without its trouble. Nasty vipers carrying some potent poison, one of them got me good. No big deal though! I was fortunately with a Cleric and he helped me deal with it. A fellow Catfolk too, so it’s nice to see something familiar in an unfamiliar land.

You know what’s ironic though? They paired me up with a mage, one of those arcane spellslingers. I swallowed it down, but I certainly was not happy with being in such close proximity (he even made my gun all glowing and stuff, it was terrifying!) or in general exposed to magic things. Which makes my first real mission all the more ironic, because we ended up recovering a necrotic artifact from an old and forgotten civilization in a mineshaft. Quite wild to imagine that I’d be the one aiding in such a thing after…well, you know, Sheliff…

Regardless…I passed that mission well enough and they made me an Initiate, so I can now use the guild for my goals while helping others who need my assistance. Time to make myself useful over here! Maybe in due time I’ll find my spot in this guild (there really seems to be a lot of magic here) and I can set out on some bigger thing that’ll help me hone my skills and senses? I definitely need it, if I want to have any chance when I return and pick up the case.

Speaking of this…I sincerely hope that Pholens stays safe from such a fate, and subsequently, you as well. I don’t know if anything else happened on Sheliff’s island (or if it spread to other islands, even) and I don’t even know if the civilians I saved all made it out in the end - it would be heartbreaking if my efforts had been for naught. The guard in Pholens is on another level than we had been, but so was that group. Please, stay safe.

I will try and write to you every so often, if anything just to show you that I’m still kicking (and some serious butt, hopefully). If you don’t receive letters from me for a very long time, then either I’m journeying or…well, “hope for the best”, as you always said, right? And “prepare for the worst”. But I’ll do what I can to fight off “the worst”.

With all my love for the two of you

Your daughter, Akira Napsy
