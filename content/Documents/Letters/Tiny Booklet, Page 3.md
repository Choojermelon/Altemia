~~Yesteda~~ Yesterday [[Rook|Ruk]] and [[Akira]] ask me to come with them to a mission. Leader [[Furiko|Fureko]] ask me to write a report on the mission to practice my writing. I am scared to write ~~becos~~ because I am bad at writing but did my best writing it

When I show the report to him, he showd me all of my ~~misst~~ ~~mus~~ errors. I wantd to write it again, but he said not to worry and do better on the next one instead

Everyone is so patient with me  but  ~~I fell~~   I feel  so very  weak

I  think about what Aster say to me yesternight about being kind to people. Maybe that is what Aster means. The [[The Skybound Wanderers|sky bound wanderers]] has been very kind to me   but I still feel  that I am  not helping as best I can

I am beaten hardly in the mission yesterday and did not know how to move the carriage until it was very late and [[(link to smite's fate episode summary goes here)|today when we go fishing with]] [[Mori|Morei]] [[Bertea|Bertehyu]] and [[Buko|Booko]] I ~~aci~~ ~~acksi~~ accidentally tied my hands with a fishing rod and with Akira too  and I can f eel her being angry at me and I dont know how to say sorrY


I need to be stronger and stop being stupid   I can not feel to see my friends fall again becaus e of me
