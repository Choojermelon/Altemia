Written by [[Chuji]], to be sung with a melodic voice and lute accompaniment:

*In the morning light, he takes a stroll,*
*'Round the guildhall with delusions of control*

*With a purr like gravel, and a tail held high,*
*Does he strut around like he owns the sky*

*Yet despite his airs and feline pride,*
*Behind his eyes does valor hide*

*Kasparr, our friend, though pompous and vain,*
*Proved to us that he's not entirely inane*

*As lightning leapt forth from his skillful paws,*
*And vanquished the bear with a friend in its jaws!*
