_Greetings, Skybound Wanderers._

_I’m Reinald, a wolf from the Ethereal Mountain. I am in need of a group of adventurers willing to escort me into Alryne, my childhood village. Years ago, when I was young, a terrible plague took everyone’s lives, including my own family. I was lucky enough to be away at the time. I know it’s a selfish request, but it would mean a lot to me if you could escort me there to retrieve an heirloom. It’s the only thing that remains of my family, and it has a lot of personal value. I have heard that some cultists were seen in the area, so I would like your protection. I will provide any further details once you’re here. Of course, your aid will not go unrewarded._

_Thank you._
