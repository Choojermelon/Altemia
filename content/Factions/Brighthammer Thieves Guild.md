A notorious thieves guild located in [[Brighthammer]], [[Everfall]].

They exist somewhat in tandem with Brighthammer's residents, taking advantage of the town's quiet nature and bribing guards so that they turn a blind eye to the guild's machinations.

Betraying or failing the guild on an important mission is often met with the death penalty.

They also have hidden establishments in other locations all across Everfall, including [[First Light]].
