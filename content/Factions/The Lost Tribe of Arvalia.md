A tribe far away from civilization. Very little is known about this tribe, and their location could not be pinpointed by cartographers until it was already too late. All that remained of this tribe were the burnt remnants of a village.

What were supposed to be treehouses suspended a few feet above the ground has been razed and reduced to ash. Upon closer inspection, scouts discovered skeletons of various sizes strewn about, clutching onto some kind of wooden item. Only a single emblem on a flag and a small amount of written documents that was spared in the carnage.

Due to the lack of history and information, not much can be gleaned from the information available other than a single name: "**Arvalia**".

Scholars and historians concluded that the tribe is probably long gone, and that there were no survivors.
