## Profile
A black-furred Catfolk girl with streaks of grey on her head. Her most stand-out feature is her singed-off fur on her left ear and the tip of her tail. She usually wears a marine-color coat over her armor, which has pockets for her ammo, in addition to an ammo-belt over her body to quickly access her bullets. Her Arquebus rifle is custom-made by herself and features, next to the steampunk-aesthetic associated with Pholens, a small cog attached on a chain to her weapon's stock.
