## Profile

Mirah was once a blue-and-white furred wyvern, who now "lives" as a phantom, sustained by the power of starlight magic. She's bound to her brother, [[Kitah]], by a bond of starlight that allows them to share their life force and sense each other's emotions. Loud and extroverted, she never hesitates to speak her mind, even if it might be uncalled for. Still it's hard for those who meet her to deny the energy she brings to every encounter she's involved in. She's got a *lot* of life for someone who's dead...
