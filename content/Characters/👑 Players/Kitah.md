## Profile

Kitah is a red-and-white furred wyvern with a lean yet strong frame. He travels with the phantom of [[Mirah]], his younger sister and dance partner even beyond death. As a dancer and martial artist, his physique and performing proficiency lends itself well to agile, graceful movements both on the stage and the battlefield, and he fights in tandem with his sister as if combat were but another dance. The more quiet and reserved of the two, Kitah usually prefers to let his body and actions speak for themselves, and his demeanor together with his handsome appearance has gained him quite a few adoring fans...
